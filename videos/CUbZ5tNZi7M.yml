title: 'Why databases cry at night? - Michael Yarichuk'
recordingDate: 1561471074
description: "In the dark of the night, if you listen carefully enough, you can hear databases cry. But why? As developers, we rarely consider what happens under the hood of widely used abstractions such as databases. As a consequence, we rarely think about the performance of databases. This is especially true to less widespread, but often very useful NoSQL databases.\n\nIn this talk we will take a close look at NoSQL database performance, peek under the hood of the most frequently used features to see how they affect performance and discuss performance issues and bottlenecks inherent to all databases.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
