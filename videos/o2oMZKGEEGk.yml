description: "The Magic of Unsupervised Learning: Teaching an AI to Understand Our World\n\nNo doubt that AI is the new kids on the block. From as simple as classifying hot-dog vs not hot-dog, recognising flower species and going towards science fiction realm in generating fake videos.\n\nThis talk will cover the problem with supervised learning which is what most of current AI technologies are based on and what is the promising trend towards the future of AI with unsupervised learning. As a use case, we will cover how image generation techniques such as Variational Auto-encoder extract knowledge from images in an unsupervised manner.\n\nPassionate in technology innovation to make peopleâ€™s life easier and with over 20 years of experience in software development, Gus has been working in various industries from 3D/Animation, Games Development, Desktop Software, mobile apps and very recently Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Well-known for unorthodox ways of solving difficult problems, Gus currently works at Carsales as the Head of AI, inventing and building many cool AI projects such as Cyclops Image Recognition and providing technical direction to various teams across Carsales on AI\n\nFor more on YOW!
