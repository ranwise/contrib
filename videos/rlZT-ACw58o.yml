description: "Translating Vitess: The Beginning - Roni He & Toliver Jue, PlanetScale \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nOpen source technology is used by teams all over the world. Lack of access to documentation in different languages may be one of the barriers to greater adoption. Vitess, a project incubated by CNCF, has been internationally adopted from the beginning with teams from India, China and elsewhere using Vitess to scale and shard MySQL. The largest Vitess on Kubernetes installation in the world is JD.com's, demonstrating that Vitess is a suitable open source tool for the Chinese market. In this maintainer track, the Vitess team will share their vision for making Vitess more accessible in China, starting with a translation sprint kick-off. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrrc"
