description: "Should You Learn Web Design As A Web Developer?\n\nIn today's topic I wanted to cover the importance of learning web design principles even if you are a developer.\n\nUnderstanding basic color theory, structure and harmony can help you become a more proficient web developer.\n\nRather then sticking to only 1 role, such as a web developer I highly encourage you to explore different things like game development, web design, animations and see what value it brings you.\n\n\n\nðŸ›´ Follow me on:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/deved94\nGithub: https://github.com/DevEdwin"
