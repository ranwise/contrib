title: 'Who''s Who? Federating Identity with Azure B2C - Andrew Coates'
recordingDate: 1562066307
description: "Often, users of your system will already know who they are, or at least think they do. Making sure you know who they are and what they can do is pretty important too.\n\nIn this session Microsoft Engineer Andrew Coates will present techniques for allowing users to log into your system with credentials from another system. Using Azure B2C allows you to offload authentication to other identity providers while keeping authorization tasks local to your system.\n\nOffload the hassles of lost passwords, expiring accounts and more, leaving you time to build and maintain the things that are important to your system.\n\nAndrew will demonstrate the setup and configuration of this powerful identity federation system allowing integration of any combination of social identities such as Facebook or twitter, as well as organisational accounts like Active Directory and others. He'll also discuss the extension points allowing complete control of the identity system including rules-based identity flows and calling out to custom REST services as part of the claims processing flow,\n\nIf your system needs to include users from outside your organisation, this is a must-see session.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
