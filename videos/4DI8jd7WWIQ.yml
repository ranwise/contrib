description: "Microsoft Azure is a great platform to use when creating your next minimal viable product (MVP).\n\nBut some services are more expensive than others. And in this talk I will show that instead of going straight to the more expensive options for your MVP, there are many cheap options available on the Azure platform. Some services even have a free-tier. \n\nUsing Azure Storage Accounts for your data storage needs, Azure Functions or Azure Container Instances for your API and computing needs can make for a very cheap and low maintenance MVP.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
