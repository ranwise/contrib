description: "Kubernetes can handle dying nodes and failing pods, but it can’t help when your application returning errors, starts slowing down, or suffers from a sudden spike in traffic. In this webinar, we’ll hear from platform owners at Nordstrom, Kairos AR, and Attest, on how they use Linkerd, CNCF’s service mesh, to instrument, monitor, and alert on service health.\n\nWe’ll dig in their approach to observability, how Linkerd is used with other tools, and how they divide responsibilities between developers and platform owners. You’ll walk away with valuable, production-vetted tips and techniques for ensuring your Kubernetes application can’t misbehave without someone knowing about it well in advance."
