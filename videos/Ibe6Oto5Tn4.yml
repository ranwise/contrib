recordingDate: 1560013630
description: "Today we did refactor the webchat from Slack and fixed the issue with names not being displayed.\nWe've used Balsamiq to create the mockups. We followed it by adding \"styled-components\" and \"moment\" to our ReactJS application.\n\nWe usually have fun with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, GraphQL, Git and many more"
