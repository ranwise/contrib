Why can't you win arguments for a new wow based on arguments and opinions? How can you make work more fun for long-term highly-skilled professionals?\n\nSaki Arkoudopoulos, Portfolio Manager Cyber Security, NXP Semiconductors\n\nGraduated as a master in computer science in the Netherlands and Belgium.
