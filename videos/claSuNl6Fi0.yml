description: "Bluetooth Mesh and Zephyr - Kai Ren, Bluetooth SIG \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBluetooth mesh was introduced in July 2017, it expands Bluetooth network topology from point-to-point, point-to-multipoint network to multipoint-to-multipoint network which allows secure networks of thousands of Bluetooth devices to be created. Bluetooth mesh is over Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE), so it inherits Bluetooth LE's low power, flexibility and other features.     Zephyr Project is a Linux Foundation Project, it's open source and started to support Bluetooth mesh from v1.9.0 in September 2017, it still makes continuous improvement release by release.     This session will present and explain the fundamental technical concepts of Bluetooth mesh, for example, provisioning, model, security keys, publish/subscribe, address and will introduce the key points of Bluetooth mesh implementation on Zephyr project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nruc"
