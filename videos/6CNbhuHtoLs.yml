description: "!!Con 2019 - Do Parsers Dream of Electric Guitars?! by Ju Liu\n\nAs a guitarist, I’ve always been fascinated by chords and their infinite variations. In this talk, we’ll see how we can build a program that reads a chord sheet, understands chords on a deeper level and finds ergonomic ways to play them on a real guitar. We will do this using a simple parser using Elm and show how much cooler it is compared to a good ol’ regular expression. Then, we’ll see what it takes to teach our program how to play the ukulele!"
