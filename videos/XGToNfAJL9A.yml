title: 'Why silos are corporate chocolate cake | Katherine Kirk | CukenFest London 2019'
recordingDate: 1561561336
description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2019 - http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nThe simple act of practising BDD can not only create awesomeness but during the process it might mean you unearth political and delusion behaviour and thinking… slap bang up against constructed silos and boundaries.\n\nWhy does that happen?  And what might we do about it?\n\nIn this short talk Katherine illuminates a very simple pattern that can help us to a) become aware and b) be more prepared for that kind of people difficulty – and most importantly inspire us to create further choices of how we might want to respond, rather than be a victim to ‘how things are’.\n\nKatherine is a ‘student of difficulty’.  She specializes in helping people, teams, divisions and companies unwind themselves out of hell scenarios and into effectiveness by using eastern philosophical approaches that she translates into practical techniques."
