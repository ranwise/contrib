description: "Jump to 1:05 where we start. Today we creted a plan for the chat section and broke it into tasks so it'll become easier to start to execute it.\nWe've used Balsamiq to create the mockups. We followed it by adding \"styled-components\" and \"moment\" to our ReactJS application.\nWe usually have fun with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, GraphQL, Git and many more"
