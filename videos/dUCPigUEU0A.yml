description: 'Sonic Pi an environment for live coding music that targets both education and professional musicians. In this demo-heavy talk we’ll cover its history – why it was created, how it evolved and what it can do today. We’ll also take a quick technical nose dive into some of the more interesting linguistic innovations that were necessary to perform live with code. For example, we’ll see how we can rhythmically sync multiple threads, use lexical blocks to close over time, accurately sleep without drifting and deterministically manipulate global state concurrently. Expect noise!'
