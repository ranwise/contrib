description: "Карл Кроуфорд\nBadoo\n\nVisual Regression Testing\n\nVisual regression testing (VRT) is a weapon-like tool used by many QAs to protect against the inevitable and unexpected (but expected) dangers of development. In recent years the area has grown in popularity, with many more commercial and custom solutions becoming available — but what is it? How can we use it? And how hard is it to implement? In this presentation, I aim to share the principles of VRT while incrementally building a VRT solution from scratch, using Puppeteer and Headless Chrome. The plan is for you to come away with both knowledge and examples to help you bring VRT to your workplace.\n\nhttps://codefest.ru"
