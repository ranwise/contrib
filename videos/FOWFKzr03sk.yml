description: "C# is a mature general purpose programming language that, along with .NET, enables developers create experiences for their users that run across multiple platforms.  There are many new and enhanced language features coming with the release of C# 8.0.  We can look forward to nullable reference types, asynchronous stream, switch expressions, ranges, default interface implementations and more.  \n\nIn this talk, we’ll take a look at some of these features, dive into demos, and see how they will help improve your developer workflow."
