  Years after Kent Beck provided JUnit, unit testing is part of most developer teams tooling. However, there's a trend that tends to threaten unit testing, claiming only integration testing can truly detects defects in software.
  In this talk, we will first define what unit testing and integration testing are, and their respective pros, cons and uses. Then, we will have a look at the unique challenges posed by integration testing. Finally, tools and techniques will be presented to somewhat remedy to that so that integration testing becomes a true asset in each software developer bag of tricks.
