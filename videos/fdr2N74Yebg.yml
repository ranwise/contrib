description: "Full title: Building applications with Serverless Framework and AWS Lambda\n\nIn this workshop, you will become familiar with how to build serverless applications using Serverless Framework (serverless.com). Serverless Framework enables you to quickly define and configure your application as well as the resources it needs using simple yaml files, and then deploy it to your cloud platform of choice. In this workshop we will be using AWS Lambda. The application itself can be written using a variety of programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python or Java. We will cover how to create a REST API to call your functions, as well as how to use other triggers such as file uploads to S3, modifications in DynamoDB tables, or Kinesis event streams."
