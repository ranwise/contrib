description: "Create Visually Compelling Developer Experiences for Kubernetes on VS Code - Ivan Towlson & Ralph Squillace, Microsoft \n\nGreat command-line developer tools are widely available for the Kubernetes ecosystem, but fabulous visual developer environments are coming along more slowly, hindering uptake among application developers who are new to container orchestration or who prefer visually rich development environments.   This session will show how to build upon the free Kubernetes extension for the open-source Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor to provide your own custom, developer-oriented experience for use with any kind of Kubernetes cluster.   We’ll show how you add to the behaviors and views in the VS Code k8s extension and demonstrate several different extensions built on it, each illustrating a different way to make Kubernetes application development easier, faster, and more effective for an ever-wider array of developers. You’ll leave empowered to create your own new visual experiences for Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXc\n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Shanghai June 24 - 26 and San Diego November 18 - 21!
