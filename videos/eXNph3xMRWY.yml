Instead of focusing only on the implementation details of a specific lib, this talk will explain several beneficial principles of state management at a high level.\n\nBased on this knowledge you will not only be able to understand patterns like FLUX and REDUX but also get the knowledge to compare specific libraries like ngRx, ngxs, akita, redux-observable.\n\nWhat are the key takeaways from this talk?\n- Evaluate the need for a state management lib\n- Compare state management libs\n- Craft their own state management\n\n\nMichael (@Michael_Hladky) is a developer, trainer, and consultant with the focus on Angular and is located in Vienna, Austria.
