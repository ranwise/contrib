description: "Keynote: The Big Leap: Conquering the Legacy System and Building a Scalable Cloud Infra in DiDi â€“ Tan Lin, Staff Engineer and Tech Lead of Elastic Cloud, DiDi \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAs the world's leading transportation platform, traditional IT architectures can no longer meet the rapid growth of DiDi's business needs. Embracing cloud native is the way to go. However, it's still a huge challenge to ensure a smooth transition from the legacy system to the new system, while minimizing the cost of business transformation.  After three years of development and hands-on experience, our custom Kubernetes-based platform, Elastic Cloud, now handles most of the core business. It manages&nbsp;~50,000 pods running on over 3000 servers.  We will describe the evolution of our cloud platform; the challenges with scheduling and isolation; the difficulties of containerization; and our technological breakthroughs. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NzAQ"
