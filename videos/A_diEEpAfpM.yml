description: "!!Con 2019 - Build your own virtual machine with /dev/kvm and Rust! by Josh Triplett\n\nVirtual machines are much simpler to build than they seem! I’ll show how to build a complete virtual machine on Linux using the /dev/kvm interface, load and run code, and even implement your own virtual devices using virtio! I’ll explain the interface, and show some libraries in Rust that help you build more complex virtual machines. By the end of the talk, you’ll not only know the foundations of cloud computing, but you’ll have ideas for other novel uses of virtualization as well!"
