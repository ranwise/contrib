title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Nick Burchâ€“Building an AI/ML powered text search system'
recordingDate: 1561715061
description: "There are some great Open Source text search / information retrieval systems, such as Apache SOLR and ElasticSearch. But could an AI / ML powered solution do better? And how would you even go about building one?\n\nBased on our experiences building a knowledge base / Q&A system, we'll guide you through the process. Learn how to get your text into a format that AI / ML techniques can work on, and how to build a simple model and recommender. Then it's Deep Learning and Neural Networks, and finally updating the models with real user feedback. Oh, and comparing it to a traditional search engine, to see if it's actually any better...\n\nNo AI or hard-core-search experience needed, we'll show you the code and techniques required to create your own!"
