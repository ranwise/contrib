description: "The gauntlet has been thrown with respect to computer vision and radiology. Leaders in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence have decried the end of the radiologist is in sight, while radiologists counter that they are irreplaceable. In this talk, we'll explore the current state of the field when it comes to automated diagnosis in radiology using machine learning.\n\nTo get a better view of what we can accomplish today and what is still missing we will start by comparing the tasks performed by the algorithms to the job required of a clinical radiologist on a daily basis. We'll then examine the unique difficulties inherent in applying machine learning to not only radiology, but any healthcare dataset, and why we can't just simply replicate the process used in other computer vision success stories, like self-driving cars. The last part of the talk will question the task itself, i.e., is automated diagnosis of radiological images the best use of our time and resources, or are there other more fruitful avenues to explore.\n\nThis talk is for anyone interested in the intersection of machine learning and healthcare and is suited for all levels. There will be some discussion of different neural network architectures, but only at a high level.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
