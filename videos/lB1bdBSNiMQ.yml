description: "At Wix We decided to switch to the Bazel build tool. The result was a dramatic improvement in performance and accuracy.\n\nAs Wix Backend grew exponentially with more than 700 micro-services, it became obvious our build times on Maven have been slowing us down. We decided to switch to the Bazel build tool while harnessing the “remote build execution” feature. The result was a dramatic improvement in performance and accuracy of builds.\n\nIn this talk, I will share with you how to achieve a successful migration to Bazel from Maven or Gradle, focusing on 5 important areas you have to think about and decide on the right approach for you, ranging from choosing the right build unit granularity to remote caching best practices.\n\nI will also describe and demonstrate some of the available tools in the eco-system that help with the migration and with making everyday work easier."
