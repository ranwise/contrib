description: "Improve CPU Utilization by Designing a New Schedule Algorithm - Xiaoming Gao, Tencent \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLarge Internet companies usually face the problem of low CPU utilization, which can be solved by deploying both offline CPU-bound loads and online services on a single node. As a penalty, the quality of online services could not be guaranteed. We did some work on this issue, and introduce an offline scheduling class based on the Linux kernel. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nru8"
