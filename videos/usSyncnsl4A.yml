description: "Network Observability with Envoy - Nic Jackson, HashiCorp \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe service mesh is built from two components the data plane and the control plane. The data plane handles the traffic from your service and is responsible for securing traffic, reliability patterns and network observability. The control plane is responsible for managing the configuration of the data plane, service catalog, x509 certificates, and service to service authorization.    To effectively observe our system, we must understand the statistics emitted from these two components to build reliable and robust systems.    In this talk, we will take a deep dive into the statistics output by key features of Envoy when used as a service mesh data plane. We will investigate network listeners, reliability patterns like timeouts, service discovery, authentication and how we can leverage these statistics to build a rich picture of the health of our system. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrpg"
