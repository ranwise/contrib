description: "Speaker: Khai Seng Hong\n\nKhai Seng has been in the design field since 2004, focusing on design research and interaction design. He was recently the Head of Singapore for Foolproof, a UK-based experience design agency. He is a firm believer in holistic experience design spanning digital, spatial, product and service domains. However, he also thinks that delivering great design for a client is only part of the equation – it is also key to help clients bring sustained impact and cultural change in the way they work. Throughout his career, Khai Seng has facilitated many workshops and training programmes with C-suite executives and working professionals to drive cultural change within organisations around design and innovation. He has many other interests, including mindful practices, coaching, organisational development and strategic foresight. Khai Seng has also spent time growing the UX community in Singapore through organising the UXSG conferences and monthly meet-ups. He is also certified as an Integral coach by New Ventures West – that involves helping people to create and maintain habits of excellence that are self-generating and self-correcting.\n\nThe road to a more conscious organization\n\nIf you could have the opportunity and power to create an organisation from scratch, how would you do it? What HR processes, cultural practices and behaviours will create a meaningful and fulfilling place to work? What would you do to reduce the biggest energy drain in an organisation – office politics?\n\nKhai Seng had that amazing opportunity starting out as part of a 3-person outfit to grow a new Singapore team for a UK-based design agency. He will be sharing his journey and philosophy of building an organisation, and the kinds of knowledge, skills and ways of being that can create a great place to work.\n\nEvent Page: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
