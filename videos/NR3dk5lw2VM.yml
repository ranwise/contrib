description: 'Spring Boot is a stack enabling you to kickstart your Spring application
  in a matter of minutes. It has been a resounding success among both developers already
  using Spring and microservices adopters. Favoring Spring Boot over the traditional
  Spring framework comes at a cost, though: you have to let Boot in control and some
  like to know everything what happens. Come to this talk to discover about auto-configuration
  and the different flavors of conditionals. After this talk, you’ll be able to understand
  Spring Boot internals and develop your own starter dependency.'
