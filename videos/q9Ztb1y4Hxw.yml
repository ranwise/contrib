description: "This is a talk about what happened when a client asked me to build a big, multi-tenant web application, and they said “we have quite a complex set of rules on what our user can do”. That turned into quite a journey.\n\nIn this session I will take you through the design we used to get ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core to provide both feature-level authorization (e.g. controlling what Web APIs/pages the user can access) and data-level authorization (i.e. controlling what data they can see).\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
