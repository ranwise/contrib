description: "When people hear \"big data\", they automatically assume a cluster of machines is required to analyze the data or build machine learning models. That may have been the case 5-10 years ago, but how times have changed! This talk shows how you can usually launch a single machine with enough RAM to handle your \"big data\" workloads.\n\nCluster computing has its place but is often overkill for data analysis and machine learning workloads. This talk will cover a number of tips and tricks for how to handle large datasets both locally and in the cloud. Case studies and code examples will be presented to show how easy it really is to analyze \"big data\" on simple infrastructures!\n\nThe audience is expected to have some familiarity with data analysis and machine learning in Python or R.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
