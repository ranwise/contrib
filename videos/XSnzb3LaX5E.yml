description: "For those of us used to solving problems with software, it can be difficult to branch out to solving problems with technology in the physical world.\n\nHowever, internet connected hardware projects can open up what we build and how people interact with technology in ways that's worth the struggle. In this session, Kristina will go from soldering an LED, connecting it to the internet, and creating a simple web app to monitor sensor data. She'll provide an overview of the different options available and give some pointers for people getting started.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
