As such, event sourcing patterns become more useful to handle the load. In this talk, I would like to talk about the different architecture patterns to implement event sourcing in your Node.js server and what architecture can fit every case.\n\nWhat are the key takeaways from this talk?\nGetting familiar with event sourcing on the server, how it can be combined into the architecture and for which different cases it can fit.\n\nTamar (@SternTwena) is a software manager and an architect.\nShe has a decade of software engineering experience in various technologies: Server side, big data, Mobile, web technologies and security.  Her main focus currently is working on code analysis in JavaScript.\n\nSign up for our Newsletter to receive preview-links every other Thursday starting 2019, April 04: https://js-kongress.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9c3420f6b5269855b07422fb5&id=f490a69da5"
