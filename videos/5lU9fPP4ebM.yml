language: English
recordingDate: 1559437929
description: "802.11ac networks bring in significant monitoring complexities with features such as multi-user MIMO, advanced beamforming, up to 8 spatial streams, extremely high speeds (Gbps) and wide channel bandwidths 80-160. Unfortunately, most Wi-Fi researchers and pentesters still use USB cards which will in most cases not be able to pick up the high speed data traffic sent over these networks. The only scalable solution is to repurpose access point platforms and create dedicated monitoring systems.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the challenges in 802.11ac monitoring, why USB based solutions fail and how we can create our custom 802.11ac monitoring platform by repurposing access point hardware.\n\nThe audience will walk out with all the knowledge, code and scripts required to create their own 802.11ac monitoring platform."
