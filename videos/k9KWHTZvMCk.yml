description: 'If it seems like humans are easy to deceive, it''s because we are. The myriad traits that make humankind so eminently exploitable are practically baked into our DNA. Too often these same traits make it into the software we build. This keynote takes an entertaining look at why humans are so easy to fool and goes on to explore what we can do to overcome our weaknesses and build more secure software.Security is everyone''s responsibility but the burden disproportionally falls on us, the developers. As software engineers, we are the last line of defense in our organization. We build the technology and that technology is constantly scanned, probed, and tested. Building truly secure software requires going beyond mere functional requirements; it requires a complete shift in how we think about problems.'
