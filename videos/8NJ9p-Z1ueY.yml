description: "Dynamic Pod Resource Boundary Adjustment in Web Scale Clusters - Cheng Wang & Xiaoyu Zhang, Alibaba \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHave you ever confused about how to set perfect resource limit for Pod? How do you balance resource efficiency with application's SLO?    In this talk, we will share practices and lessons learned from adjusting Pod resource limits dynamically for Web-scale clusters at Alibaba Group by co-locating Pods with different QoS classes on the same node and adjusting Pod resource limits dynamically (especially during resource contention).    After applying this effort in production clusters, we were able to improve the cluster resource usage by 14%~30%, tail latency (95 percentile) by 76%~87%, and TPS (transactions per second) by 107%~163%, respectively.    The audiences would benefit from experience of improving the resource utilization and application performance for their own clusters, with Kubernetes native approaches. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NroW"
