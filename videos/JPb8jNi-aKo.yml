description: "Using Open Source Software to Build an Industrial-grade Embedded Linux Platform from Scratch - SZ Lin, Moxa \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBuilding an embedded Linux platform is like a puzzle; placing the suitable software components in the right positions will constitute an optimal platform. However, selecting suitable components is difficult since it depends on different application scenarios. The basic components of an embedded Linux platform include the bootloader, Linux kernel, toolchain, root filesystem, it also needs the tools for image generation, upgrade, and testing. There are abundant resources in the Linux ecosystem with these components and tools; however, selecting the suitable modules and tools is still a key challenge for system designers.    In this presentation, SZ Lin will analyze the features in each component and compare common open source software with each tool. In addition, he will also share the experiences in selecting each component and tools for industrial-grade embedded Linux platform. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NruZ"
