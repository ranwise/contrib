description: "DOES19 London — Functional programming had mostly been relegated to academic endeavors until recently. What’s changed is that our apps are now distributed systems and are simply too complex for us to reason about without help. Programming intent and ceding some of the control to an interpreter takes makes creating solutions to very hard problems doable.\n \nWe’ve seen an increase in the uptake of functional programming for application development using languages such as Kotlin and Clojure, and now we are seeing some key tenets of functional programming seeping into operations. Through a series of demonstrations, in this talk I’ll draw some parallels between functional programming and tools that are increasingly used on the operations side of the house. If part of DevOps is about building empathy between developers and operators (and it is), then shared core tenets help.\n\nFunctional Programming for (Dev)Operations and Infrastructure\n\nCornelia Davis, Senior Director of Technology, Pivotal\n\nCornelia is Sr. Director of Technology at Pivotal, where she helps customers develop and execute on their cloud platform strategies. Responsible for guiding clients on the technical elements of broader transformation, she helps development and operations teams, and IT executives understand and adopt new systems, platforms and processes, as the central part of delivering greater value to their customers. Fundamentally, Cornelia helps enterprises shift from a mindset where IT is a necessary evil, to becoming software-driven businesses with IT at the core. Finally, through these deep engagements with clients, Cornelia also brings valuable insight back into Pivotal, driving advancements in software and services offerings.\n \nWhen not doing those things you can find her on the yoga mat or in the kitchen.\n\nDOES19 London\nDOES 2019 EUR\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
