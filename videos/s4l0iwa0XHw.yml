Yes, they release early and often. But they also build control and observability into their CD pipeline to turn releases into results.\nProgressive delivery and the statistical observation of real users (sometimes known as “shift right testing” or “feature experimentation”) are essential CD practices. They free teams to move fast, control risk and focus engineering cycles on work that delivers results, not just releases.\nLearn implementation strategies and best practices for adding control and observability to your CD pipeline: Where should you implement progressive delivery controls: front-end or back-end?
