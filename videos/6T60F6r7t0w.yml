description: "!!Con 2019 - Hiding my love inside a MIDI file! by David Mauricio Delgado Ruiz\n\nEver wanted to communicate a secret message to friend, lover or the national security officer of your country? (yes, I’m talking to you spies from all over the world). You might think end-to-end encryption got you covered, but after 2013, the NSA leaks and all that stuff, you never know! What do you do? You go back to the basics: Steganography! In this talk I want to share with you the basics of steganography and how you can use use it to hide messages in the vintage MIDI files we all loved from the 90’s. More specifically, we are going to hide an audio message within the channels, patterns and events of a MIDI file. Finally, we will decode the message and listen to it!"
