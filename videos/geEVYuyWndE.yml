description: "Web-scale IT – modern description for the “web companies-like” enterprise datacentre architectural design.\nInvented by industry leaders (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc), used by the majority of the biggest enterprised today.\n\nDe facto – quiet revolution in the enterprise IT, changed the landscape dramatically. New leaders, older vendors losing the market.\n\nKey principals – commodity hardware, software-defined everything, “human-less” architecture, scale-out instead of scale-up, “each hardware component will eventually fail”, micro-segmentation and microservices, hyper convergency – compute and data locality."
