description: "!!Con 2019 - Manual algorithmic art: You can draw an Indian floor pattern that covers an infinite area! by Veena Sankaranarayanan\n\nWomen in India have been practicing the algorithmic art of Kolam for generations. Believed to have originated over 5000 years ago, kolams adorn the threshold of every house in India. The simplest form, practiced widely in South India is a knotted kolam where dots are placed in a grid-like framework and symmetrical patterns are traced around the dots. This talk addresses the maths behind a specific kind of knotted kolam, which uses the Fibonacci series to generate square and rectangular patterns of any size. After this talk, anyone in the audience will be able to draw a square/rectangular knotted kolam of any size!"
