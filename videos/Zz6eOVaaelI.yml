description: "In this mini crash course we are going to learn everything about Sass.\nWhat Sass allows us to do is write alot of cool things that we would normally wouldn't be able to do in normal CSS.\n\nWith Sass we can create variables, use imports and partials to separate our css code into smaller chunks, we can use mixins to create small functions that allow us to reuse css code, nesting allows us to write children elements directly inside the parent element and much more!\n\nWe will also look at a tool called Live Sass Compiler which is going to take our scss code and convert it to regular css with autoprefixer.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about css and sass then take the time to watch this sass crash course covered in 20 minutes!\n\n❤Become a patreon for exclusive videos and more!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/dev_ed\n\n\n📕 Things covered in this video:\n \n- How to add sass compiler to our project\n- How to link our sass to html\n- Sass variables\n- Mixins\n- Nesting\n- Extending\n- Operators\n- Partials and Imports\n\n📔 Materials used in this video:\n\n VSCode\n\n🛴 Follow me on:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/deved94\nGithub: https://github.com/DevEdwin\n\n🎵 Music:\n\nOutro: \nLAKEY INSPIRED - Me 2 (Feat.
