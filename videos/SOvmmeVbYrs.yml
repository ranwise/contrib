description: "Deep Dive: API Machinery SIG - David Eads, Red Hat & Daniel Smith, Google \n\nThis Deep Dives will cover the recent developments of Sig API Machinery. Sig API Machinery covers API registration and discovery, admission control, storage migration, conversion, defaulting, OpenAPI, CustomResourceDefinition, garbage collection, quota, and client libraries. We will have the chance to dive into the topics and to answer technical questions around them. One main theme will be server side apply which is supposed to ship as as alpha in 1.14. This will have a big impact on the ecosystem and therefore we want to take this deep dive as chance to reach developers who will have to adapt their operator logic to work well as an apply actor. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkO"
