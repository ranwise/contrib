description: 'Everyone in an agile product team makes decisions every single day that affect the end user. Whether they''re a PM, a designer, an engineer, or someone else â€“ they''re making decisions for users. Those decisions are better when the individual has empathy for the humans who use the product. What''s better for building that empathy than being part of research? But it''s more than that. I''ve seen it time and time again. Teams who research together are happier. They collaborate better, they''re motivated, they stay focused on the problem they''re solving. And happier teams means happier people. In this talk, I lay out a simple and accessible way to include whole teams in research - and how that makes entire teams better.'
