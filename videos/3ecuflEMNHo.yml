description: "!!Con 2019 - low-fi hip hop beats to npm install to!! by Melody Starling\n\nListen to your computer. You may hear the faint sound of fans, the quiet hums of electricity, and the occasional clanking of keyboards. But what if I told you there are other ways to listen to your computer? There are tons of things happening in the background of an operating system, and with the power of of a digital synthesizer, you can hear (and relax to) the sounds of a package manager hard at work!"
