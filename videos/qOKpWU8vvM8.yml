description: "Full Title: Plant factory: sensor data, machine learning and optimization for data-driven vertical farming\n\nIn this talk, I will outline some relevant processes in running an automated indoor plant factory and the process we use to automate these as we scale. In particular, I will focus on how the Data & AI team works with other teams such as the Agricultural Science, Operations, Supply Chain and Robotics teams.\n\nAs an example, I will discuss a recent project, in which the decisions around the environment to grow crop in, where in the vertical farm to place crop, and how to schedule work in the farm were automated. This project touches agriculture, since there may be different ways different crops react to an environment, but also operations and supply chain, since scheduling farm work impacts our ability to work efficiently and manage our product stock. This automation project requires high-quality data, such as yield predictions from computer vision, sensor data that can tell us which positions are suitable for certain crop to grow in, operations data, such as the expected time it takes to complete a task, and other data related to automation.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
