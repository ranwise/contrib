title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Edward Kmett - Logic Programming à la Carte'
recordingDate: 1562146517
description: "I've been working on a logic programming framework in Haskell, called guanxi (關係) with an eye towards scalability. To build it I leaned heavily on my previous work on propagators and a bunch of other little bits and pieces of algebra and category theory in the design process. A number of patterns have arisen repeatedly throughout the process of building this library. I'll give a tour through the current state of guanxi and try to extract some of the more reusable bits of its design for your inspection.\n\nEdward spent most of his adult life trying to build reusable code in imperative languages before realizing he was building castles in sand. He converted to Haskell in 2006 while searching for better building materials. He now chairs the Haskell core libraries committee, collaborates with hundreds of other developers on over 150 projects on github, builds tools for quants and traders using the purely-functional programming-language Ermine for S&P Capital IQ, and is obsessed with finding better tools so that seven years from now he won’t be stuck solving the same problems with the same tools he was stuck using seven years ago.\n\nFor more on YOW!
