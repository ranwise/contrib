recordingDate: 1562749202
description: "On May 25th the European Union enacted new privacy laws that apply uniformly to all member nations. These rules will pretty much apply to anyone who builds or owns IT systems and the implications may surprise you.\n\nIn this practical and entertaining talk, Johannes explores how a simple example of an everyday application gets entangled with privacy issues and how to untangle yourself.\n\nAs a side effect of the going to the talk, you will be able to impress your friends with statements like \"according GDPR article 7, subsection 4, this is not a legally obtained consent\" - a phrase that works surprisingly well at parties.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
