description: "Patrick Kua is the CTO of the mobile bank N26 (Berlin, Germany), where he is building the engineering group that will change modern retail banking for people like you and me. Formerly a Principal Technical Consultant at ThoughtWorks, he is the author of three books, The Retrospective Handbook, Talking with Tech Leads and most recently, Building Evolutionary Architectures. As a software engineer, you will have learned that \"naming things\" will remain one of the most difficult tasks in our industry. This is even more confusing when it comes to roles and responsibilities for the Tech Lead role. After interviewing many people playing technical leadership roles, establishing a European-wide Tech Lead training program in his last company, and training 100+ Tech Leads around the world, Patrick will share his lessons learned about what exactly a Tech Lead is, and what it takes to make the role successful.\n\nEVENT:\n\nBuild Stuff 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPatrick Kua\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nBuild Stuff Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nBuild Stuff YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCis5B3Zru-vymPRcbpM1NEA"
