title: 'Designing Components for Fun, Profit and Sanity by Yishu See | JSConf.Asia 2019'
language: English
recordingDate: 1561248468
description: "In recent years, web applications have largely converged to a modular approach, where self contained components make up the basic building blocks of an app. Components have offered us a way to logic in bite size digestives but they can also grow to become huge unwieldy monsters.\nImagine you find yourself five years into a project, in a team of 10, over a thousand components, and a chance (albeit daunting task) to start with a fresh codebase. How would you begin designing the components?\n\nYishu is bad at things. Bouldering, speaking Japanese, crow pose; all bad. Thank goodness she's okay at making computers do things. Currently she is a software engineer at Carousell, contributing to the web platform. Before that in her career, she has taken on multiple roles - iOS engineer, backend engineer and fleetingly a product designer. Her current favourite function is .split().\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore - 14 June 2019\n\nSource: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
