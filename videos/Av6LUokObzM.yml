description: "SIG Service Catalog - Jonathan Berkhahn, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCome learn about the Kubernetes Service Catalog Project. Service Catalog lets you provision cloud services, regardless of where they are hosted, directly from the comfort of native Kubernetes tooling. Through use of the Open Service Broker API, app developers can use third party services directly from your Kubernetes application. We will walk through provisioning a database through Service Catalog, and then connect it to an application running on the cluster. Weâ€™ll also briefly cover recent work and future plans for Service Catalog. Finally, we would love for anyone considering contributing to stop by and get an introduction, meet the maintainers and learn how to become a contributor!  \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrrK"
