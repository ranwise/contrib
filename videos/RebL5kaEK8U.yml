description: "Speaker:\r\nPK Seet and CO Cheong\r\n\r\nGreenfossil started off as a Java team and considered themselves a proficient Java practitioner. As a lean team, they are always looking for ways to improve their effectiveness in terms of software design, development and maintainability. They decided to take the leap to Scala in 2012. The journey has its gains and pains and they would like to share their experience with people considering Scala and those still on its learning curve like themselves. Beyond this they hope to follow up with more sessions to talk about their software stack which underpins all their product development.\r\n\r\nAbout the presenters:\r\nPK Seet and CO Cheong co-founded Greenfossil in 2005 with the tag line \"Connecting and Forging Ahead\". Since then, they have evolved into a full stack web development team and developed robust enterprise applications serving the needs of their customers in Healthcare, Society & Community and Education.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/events/262216565/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Herdy Handoko\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/peVb/"
