title: 'Building APIs Rapidly with Azure Functions - Lars Klint'
recordingDate: 1561455065
description: "APIs are what makes the Internet go around. Every SaaS, data driven and on-demand kitten business exposes their data over an external or internal API. Which means you need one too, right? Of course you do.\nCreating an API that conforms with OpenAPI standards, can scale up and out, can be extended easily, and can be easily maintained is the Nirvana of API architecture. This is exactly the promise of building an API with Azure Functions, and it is super fast too!\n\nIn this session, you will learn to quickly create a full blown API using Azure Functions, create a proxy to forward requests, adhere to OpenAPI standards, easily extend and more. At the end of the talk we will have built an API that is (almost) production ready straight away. We then compare this process to other API frameworks to get the real world picture.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
