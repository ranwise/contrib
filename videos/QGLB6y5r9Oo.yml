description: "Annual reports give a comprehensive overview of companies their activities and (financial) performance. Reviewing these annual reports, however, is currently a manual task. Besides that this is laborious, it is also biased.\n\nAs PwC's role as a trusted advisor, we aimed to improve the review process its quality and objectiveness using machine learning. Therefore, we developed an application that quantitatively analyses the content of annual reports and provide the auditors with several metrics such as readability and sentiment score.\n\nDuring this talk we will provide insight into our process by taking you along the journey an annual report will follow. From the uploading of the PDF report to our application on Azure, to the extraction of text via OCR with pdftotree and ending at the analysis of the text through NLP with spaCy.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
