description: 'Given the resurgence of neural network-based techniques in recent years, it is important for data science practitioner to understand how to apply these techniques and the tradeoffs between neural network-based and traditional statistical methods. This lecture discusses two specific techniques: Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The former is one of the most important class of multivariate time series statistical models applied in finance while the latter is a neural network architecture that is suitable for time series forecasting. I''ll demonstrate how they are implemented in practice and compares their advantages and disadvantages. Real-world applications, demonstrated using python and Spark, are used to illustrate these techniques. While not the focus in this lecture, exploratory time series data analysis using time-series plot, plots of autocorrelation (i.e. correlogram), plots of partial autocorrelation, plots of cross-correlations, histogram, and kernel density plot, will also be included in the demo. The attendees will learn - the formulation of a time series forecasting problem statement in context of VAR and RNN - the application of Recurrent Neural Network-based techniques in time series forecasting - the application of Vector Autoregressive Models in multivariate time series forecasting - the pros and cons of using VAR and RNN-based techniques in the context of financial time series forecasting - When to use VAR and when to use RNN-based techniques Session hashtag: #DS8SAIS'
