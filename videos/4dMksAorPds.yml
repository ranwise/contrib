title: 'Reduce defects with automated testing - Jason Zelos'
recordingDate: 1559280713
description: "This talk will cover the full gamut of automated testing from pure unit tests to full end to end testing. I will explain why testing is important, the various kinds of test and how they fit into the test pyramid. You will see practical examples of unit testing in C# using one of the more popular assertion libraries and mocking frameworks. I'll show a similar kind of unit test in Angular and explain why unit testing in angular is more complex and can in some instances be considered integration testing. I'll explain about code metrics and how to use code coverage tools to ensure your that riskiest areas of code are tested. Finally, I will show full end to end tests in both Angular and C# and describe some of the most common pitfalls.\n\nJason Zelos\n\nCurrently lead software engineer at Flagship Group, a non-profit social housing provider. I have worked in the East of England for both public and private sector organisations in Education, Telecoms, Retail and Housing as a software developer, architect and occasional project manager for around 20 years."
