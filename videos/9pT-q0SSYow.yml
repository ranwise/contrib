title: 'Introduction to the Component-based API by Leonardo Losoviz | JSConf.Asia 2019'

description: "The Component-based API is a new concept of API which pushes further from GraphQL the boundaries of how much data can be retrieved in a single request, how data is organized into an effective hierarchical structure, and how fast can data be retrieved from the DB. We will learn what this new API looks like, how to use it, and how our application can become more modular through it.\n\nLeonardo is an independent open source developer, creator of a framework for building modular websites called \"PoP\". The only non-musician in his family, this doesn't bother him, because coding is also making art. He lives in a loop: he dreams of code and, when he wakes up, he codes his dreams.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore - 15 June 2019\n\nSource: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
