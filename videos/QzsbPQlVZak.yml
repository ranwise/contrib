description: "Web Assembly has arrived in all major browsers. With it being in plain sight instead of hidden behind browser flags we can start and bring our high performance applications to the browser. \n\nIn this workshop weâ€™re going to look at the basics of WebAssembly and see what is already in the browsers today and what is yet to come. From there we will implement a real performance heavy task in our browser. We will compare the performance of our WebAssembly code to a plain JavaScript version. Afterwards you will be able to decide when to use WebAssembly and what specific performance benefits It will give you.\n\nEVENT:\n\nJSConf.Asia 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPatrick Walther\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU2tKJIjNIU"
