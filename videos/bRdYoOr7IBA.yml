description: "IT Spring 2019, Minsk\nProduct & Data Track \n\nData Science strategy and transformation for large enterprise - Alexey Natekin\nData Science is no longer a hype-mongering label. When settled properly it becomes a fruitful function that can successfuly deliver value to business. In particular, some companies can successfully perform and manage hundreds of ongoing Data Science initiatives, sustainably and properly tied to business. Recently even a new term called \"AI transformation\" emerged, as a spiritual successor to \"Data-Driven enterprise\", but slightly patched and up to date. \nIn this talk I will share an overview of these transformation processes, as well as some potentially usefull recipies for both design and implementation of a successfull DS/AI strategy. In particular, what are the key barriers, choke points and strategic fuckups one enterprise can encouter on their path.\n\nVideo Partner â€“ AgileLAB (https://www.agilelab.org/)"
