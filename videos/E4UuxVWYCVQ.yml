title: Mutation Testing to the rescue of your Tests
language: English

recordingDate: 1495144800
description: Unit testing ensures your production code is relevant. But what does
  ensure your testing code is relevant? Come discover mutation testing and make sure
  your never forget another assert again. In the realm of testing, the code coverage
  metrics is the most often talked about. However, it doesn’t mean that the test has
  been useful or even that an assert has been coded. Mutation testing is a strategy
  to make sure that the test code is relevant. In this talk, I will explain how Code
  Coverage is computed and what its inherent flaw is. Afterwards, I will describe
  how Mutation Testing work and how it helps pointing out code that is tested but
  leave out corner cases. I will also demo PIT, a Java production-grade framework
  that enables Mutation Testing.
