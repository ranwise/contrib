description: "Using Ambassador to Build Cloud-Native Applications - Steve Flanders, Omnition \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIn Cloud-Native environments it is common to deploy one or more API gateways to route, authenticate, limit, and observe traffic. In Kubernetes, constructs such as annotations are a powerful way to configure applications. Ambassador is an open-source API gateway built on top of Lyftâ€™s Envoy proxy which uses Kubernetes constructs to provide dynamic configuration options.     In this session we will demonstrate how Ambassador can be used to migrate to or build Cloud-Native applications via different architectures and configuration approaches. Considerations for internal versus external traffic, ingestion versus queries, multi-tenant environments and non-provided services will be covered. You will leave with an understanding of how Ambassador is run in real production environments, how it is different from other API gateway solutions available today and how you can get started with Ambassador. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrlZ"
