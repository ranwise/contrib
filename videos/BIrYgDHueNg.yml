recordingDate: 1562317579
description: "Microservices popularity has grown as a lot of organizations are moving their applications to microservices which enables their teams to autonomously own and operate their own microservices. The microservices have to communicate with each other so how do you efficiently connect, secure, and monitor those services?\n\nIstio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies and aggregate telemetry data.\n\nIn this session, we will cover what is service mesh and why it is important for you, what are the core components of Istio, how to empower your microservices to leverage the features that Istio provides on top of Kubernetes such as service discovery, load balancing, resiliency, observability, and security.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
