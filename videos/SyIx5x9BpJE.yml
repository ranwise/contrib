description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl)\n26th of September 2014\n\nKarl-Henrik Nillson - \"Hacking Your Doorbell\"\n\n\"The internet of Things is a pretty big things by now and shows no sign of stopping - in fact over the last year the \"buzz\" about IoT have increased fivefolded and the .NET community is going to find loads of work in this Area.\n\nBut the problem is that we currently don't have a good middle place for aspiring developers that just want to build something cool, the developers that are not in IoT projects and are looking to dive in, learn and create home IoT projects.\n\nI have been creating network connected items for a long time and never really understood why the fact that my doorbell could be muted with a click of a button in my WindowsPhone was such a big deal to my developer friends, especially since it was nothing more to it than a 433 Mhz transmitter pair, an mCU and a transistor to it.\n\nWe need to get it out there to all our super skilled developers that hacking hardware and connecting the physical world to our computers is cheap, easy and fun!\n\nThis talk asserts the possible technology choices such as Arduino, Netduino, AVR and some other interesting choices, how basic reverse engineering of existing hardware is done (analysis, tools for analysis etc) and how to get started hacking hardware in a Microsoft/C# .NET (well mostly) environment TODAY!\""
