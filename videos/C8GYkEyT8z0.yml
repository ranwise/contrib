description: "7 Missing Factors for Your Production-Quality 12-Factor Apps - Michael Elder & Shikha Srivastava, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWe've all heard of and practiced the 12-factor principles for effective microservices. With Kubernetes, many of these factors are directly supported. In this talk, we ask the question: are the 12 factors sufficient for building production-quality, scalable, and secure microservices?  Based on our experience creating enterprise-grade production-ready apps based on Kubernetes, we identified 7 missing factors that are often overlooked. These additional factors ensure that you can upgrade, secure, and scale your apps all the way to production. We'll describe these 7 factors and provide specific guidance on how to adopt them in the delivery of your next Kubernetes microservice. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrlN"
