description: "Developers and designers don’t often use all SVG superpowers in their React applications. This way, to drive your inspiration, I am going to tell you the story of an SVG image that one day made a very special friend - ReactJS. Alone and despised by its family, SVG yelled Enough! Now you’ll see what I’m all about!. And with this epic scream, little SVG unveiled all its superpowers. She took her friend React and they showed the world how to come up with creative solutions together.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReact Amsterdam 2019 Conference https://react.amsterdam\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nElizabet Oliveira\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
