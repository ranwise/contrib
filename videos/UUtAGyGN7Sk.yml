description: "Real World Architecture - Building a Global Cross-Cloud Monitoring Platform - Dominic Green, Improbable & Yifan Zhao, Improbable \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPrometheus allows us to monitor applications and infrastructure running within a Kubernetes cluster with ease. Starting out with just a few servers it's simple to configure and run, as you start to scale out you adopt novel strategies such as federation and meta monitoring to ensure you can get all the metrics you need. But what happens when you scale out past a single cluster? What happens when you scale out past a single cloud provider?    In this talk, you will learn how at Improbable we have been able to successfully scale our metrics platform to reach a global scale. Prometheus is a solid foundation to our platform which is extended by Thanos an OSS project to allow global querying and high availability of Prometheus scrapers. Then by adding in Envoy, we can unlock cross-cluster, cross-cloud communication allowing our engineers to monitor our platform across the globe. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nro8"
