recordingDate: 1561725799
description: "Don’t panic! Often when I join a team, my new colleagues second guess each and every behavior. Inevitably, this leads to some awkward situations (and in the wake of #MeToo, even fear)!\n\nAlthough women still make up a rather small percentage of the tech workforce, we’re not as uncommon as narwhals or unicorns, so I’d like to take a few minutes to talk candidly about how we can make this transition smoother and simpler for both sides. Applying a programmer’s pragmatism to social interactions, we can debug our working environment and hopefully make it run more smoothly.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
