title: 'Mark Heckler - Full-stack Reactive Kotlin with Project Reactor & Spring Boot 2'
language: English
recordingDate: 1562056503
description: "Reactive programming offers Java & Kotlin developers a way to build message-driven, elastic, resilient, and responsive services…yet many developers don’t know where to begin. The Reactive Streams initiative provides a baseline and Project Reactor provides a great way to become immediately productive, leveraging reactive capabilities from end to end. Whether you’re coming from a Spring MVC environment or a functional perspective, Reactor empowers you to spin up fully reactive Spring Boot 2 applications quickly and efficiently.\nIn this talk, the presenter dives into the net-new Netty-based web runtime and shows you how to:\n\nintegrate easily with existing Spring-stack technologies\neasily transition from blocking to reactive applications & systems\ndefine your API in an imperative style and functionally, reaping all benefits both ways\nleverage powerful new testing mechanisms to make code better and life easier\nThe presenter will code all examples live and in real time. This is not an abstract discussion, come to gain real, practical knowledge!\nThe good thing with keeping things a bit loose in terms of which language is that I can take the temperature of the room and whip up a Java reactive web client to consume the Kotlin service we live-code, if folks want to see how it’s done using Java."
