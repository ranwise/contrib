recordingDate: 1562055992
description: "When we create applications and products we simplify the messy, complex and inconvenient nature of the real world and follow established but flawed approaches to interfaces and interactions.\n\nIn this session we'll discuss the patterns and practices we can follow to make our solutions work for everyone. We'll cover everything from form design to algorithms to thinking about how we store and structure our applications data. \n\nEveryone wins when we all play - come to this session and make sure your applications and products work for all.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
