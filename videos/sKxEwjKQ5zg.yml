description: "When I got into Elm as a React developer in 2014, I only expected to learn a pleasant functional programming language. I never thought I would discover a whole new programming flow—a flow where I could spend hours productively writing UI code without slowing down to open a browser and visually check my progress. What kind of bizarro front-end Web development world is that? What is it about Elm's design that makes this kind of flow possible, and what assumptions does it challenge about the most effective ways to write code? Does it take a whole different programming language to pull this off, or are there ways to get the same benefits in any language? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this talk. Come find out!\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRichard Feldman\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish Øredev videos."
