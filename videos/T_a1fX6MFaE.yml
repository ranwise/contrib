description: "The Real Costs of Open Source Sustainability - VM (Vicky) Brasseur, Juniper Networks \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIn 2016 Nadia Eghbal released \"Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure,\" which shines a light on how few people maintain the software that underpins a large amount of the internet and the services that run on it.    The software world has rallied around Open Source Sustainability. Going with what they know, folks mostly focus on paying FOSS developers. Funding drives were funded. Foundations were founded. Startups started up. Venture capitalists ventured that capital.    Money isn't the only part of sustainable FOSS projects. Sustainability is a multi-faceted concept that can't work if people focus on only one of its many elements.    This talk will:    * Review literature around the concept of sustainability  * Propose a definition that more accurately details what \"sustainable\" means to FOSS  * Provide tips for starting with your FOSS sustainability efforts \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrtM"
