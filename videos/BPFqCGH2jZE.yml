title: 'Beautiful Apps on data from everywhere: With Oracle APEX'
language: English
recordingDate: 1560815774
description: "Abstract:\nThe times, when there were only a few enterprise databases, holding all the relevant data, are over. Today, enterprises have to deal with data from many sources: databases, non-relational stores or REST APIs provide the data for developers to use in their apps. Applications on top of that data are often required very quickly. In this session, we will look at some public REST APIs and Oracle APEX as the Low Code tool. The audience will learn how not only to quickly build applications on REST or database data but also how to integrate public data from a REST API with local data from an Oracle database. Tips and Tricks for dealing with REST APIs from an enterprise application point of view will wrap the session up."
