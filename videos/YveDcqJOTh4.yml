description: "Speaker: Ben Dechrai\r\n\r\nAPI development is fun! But password security is boring. It's also harder than you'd think. Find out how to ramp up your development productivity, and concentrate on the core purpose of your product, by adding OAuth and OpenID Connect support, and leaving the identity and security to a dedicated identity management platform.\r\n\r\nBen Dechrai is a technologist with a staunch focus on security and privacy. This started at the age of 11, when he wrote software to stop his mum from breaking the family PC, and resulted in his working as a developer advocate for Auth0. He enjoys helping developers find the joy of experimentation, from ethical skulduggery to subversive automation, and can be found on Twitter and Instagram at @bendechrai.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/262961582/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/pxzn/"
