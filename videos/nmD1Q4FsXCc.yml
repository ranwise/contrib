description: "PHP has been around for almost as long as the Web. 25 years. Join me for a fun look at the highlights (and lowlights) of this crazy trip. But I will also be trying to convince you to upgrade your PHP version. The performance alone should be enough, if not, I have a few other tricks up my sleeve to try to win you over. Performance optimization, static analysis, zero-cost profiling, dead code elimination, and escape analysis are just some of the concepts that will be covered along with a preview of new features coming in future versions.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
