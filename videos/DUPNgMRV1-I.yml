title: 'Introducing Kubeflow (w. Special Guests Tensorflow and Apache Spark)'
recordingDate: 1555623247
description: "Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence has exploded in popularity in the last five years, but the nagging question remains, “How to put models into production?” Engineers are typically tasked to build one-off systems to serve predictions which must be maintained amid a quickly evolving back-end serving space which has evolved from single-machine, to custom clusters, to “serverless”, to Docker, to Kubernetes. In this talk, we present KubeFlow- an open source project which makes it easy for users to move models from laptop to ML Rig to training cluster to deployment. In this talk we will discuss, “What is KubeFlow?”, “why scalability is so critical for training and model deployment?”, and other topics.\n\nUsers can deploy models written in Python’s skearn, R, Tensorflow, Spark, and many more. The magic of Kubernetes allows data scientists to write models on their laptop, deploy to an ML-Rig, and then devOps can move that model into production with all of the bells and whistles such as monitoring, A/B tests, multi-arm bandits, and security."
