description: "Monitor Your Java Applications with the Elastic Stack: Logs, Metrics, Pings, and Traces\n\nSpeaker: David Pilato (Elastic)\n\nDavid is a Developer and Evangelist at elastic (the company behind Elasticseach). He is the creator of the Elastic French-speaking User Group.\n\nHe is a frequent speaker about all things Elastic, in conferences, for User Groups and in companies with BBL talks.\n\nIn his free time, he enjoys coding and DeeJaying, just for fun.\n\nHe lives near Paris, France with his family.\n\nMonitor Your Java Applications with the Elastic Stack: Logs, Metrics, Pings, and Traces\n\n“With microservices, every outage is like a murder mystery” is a common complaint. But it doesn’t have to be!\n\nThis talk gives an overview on how to monitor distributed applications. We dive into:\n\nSystem metrics: Keep track of network traffic and system load.\nApplication logs: Collect structured logs in a central location.\nUptime monitoring: Ping services and actively monitor their availability and response time.\nApplication metrics: Get the information from the application’s metrics and health endpoints via REST or JMX.\nRequest tracing: Trace requests through a distributed system and show how long each call takes and where errors are happening.\nAnd we will do all of that live, since it is so easy and much more interactive that way.\n\nEvent Site: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
