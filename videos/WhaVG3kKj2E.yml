title: 'Becoming a Smooth Operator: A look at low-level Flink APIs and what they enable - Addison Higham'
recordingDate: 1562254124
description: "Becoming a Smooth Operator: A look at low-level Flink APIs and what they enable\n\nAs Flink has evolved, it has continued to layer on new, higher-level APIs and improve older APIs to help succinctly solve problems in different domains. However, sometimes it is useful to understand what is happening at a low-level and possibly even use the lower level constructs to enable complex functionality that isn't otherwise possible.\n\nIn this talk, we will dig into the internals of the low-level StreamOperator API and understand what this API provides and how Flink uses and builds upon this functionality in other layers. Additionally, we will look at a real-life use case at Instructure where the StreamOperator API was used to build a system that reads an archived stream from files and then seamlessly transitions to a live stream in the same Flink job, something not readily possible with the more well known Flink APIs.\n\nFlink Forward San Francisco 2019\n#flinkforward"
