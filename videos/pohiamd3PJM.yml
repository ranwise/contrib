description: "containerd - Lantao Liu, Google & Wei Fu, Alibaba \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nJoin containerd maintainers to learn how to leverage containerd’s design and APIs to use, customize and enhance containerd’s capabilities. We’ll cover building custom snapshotters for special storage needs and integrating with custom runtimes for stronger isolation. Understanding containerd architecture and data flow is key to extending it’s functionality. In this talk, we’ll look at the internals of containerd (covering its components and dataflows) then dive into how external plugins work with containerd. We’ll go over using containerd’s smart client API and plugins to make new/custom integrations. We will demonstrate how various sandbox technologies can be integrated with containerd to work with Kubernetes, including Amazon’s Firecracker, Google’s gVisor etc. Attendees will leave the talk understanding how they can extend/modify containerd to support enhanced integrations for custom production deployments. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrqY"
