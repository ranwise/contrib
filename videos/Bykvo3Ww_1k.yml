description: "!!Con 2019 - Speling werds egspressively with rrkurrent nuril nedwirques! by Allison Parrish\n\nSpelling isn’t just about memorization and following rules—it’s a way of making meaning. I trained recurrent neural network models to spell words (translate phonemes to letters) and to sound words out (translate letters to phonemes) and I want to show off some of the weird outputs you can coax from the models if you poke them just right. I’ll demonstrate how the models let me automatically ririt tixts without using potticulor l’tirs, generate strigs thadte soude like they have a ruddy doeds, and transmogrify words into their 1950s pulp sci-fi equivalents (“Welcome to Bang-Gan-Kan in M’anhoten Gnhu Yorq, puny terran!”). Along the way, we’ll discuss why “jabberwocky” is spelled “jabberwocky,” what Russian Futurists have in common with J.R.R. Tolkien, and why “standardized spelling” is kind of a fake idea."
