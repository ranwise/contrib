title: 'Correcting Common Async/Await Mistakes in .NET - Brandon Minnick'
recordingDate: 1562748179
description: "Did you know that the .NET compiler turns our async methods into classes? And that .NET adds a try/catch block to each of these classes, potentially hiding thrown exceptions? It's true!\n\nIn this session, we will learn how to best use async/await in C# by analyzing how .NET compiles our async code.\n\nJoin me as we take an existing app and optimize its async code together, showing off performance gains, better exception handling, improved run-time speed, and smaller app size!\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
