description: "DOES19 London — Comcast is a leader in media and technologies and serves millions of customers with broadband, streaming media, smart home technologies and content. The scale and complexity of Comcast with 1000s of engineers as well as its history could make it difficult to roll out new cultural changes and technologies. Yet, Comcast embarked on the journey to become a technology company with leading edge software development practices like open source, DevOps and security practices. I will share our journey into becoming an open source contributor and leader and some of the key elements that helped with this transformation.\n\nNithya Ruff, Head of Open Source, Comcast\n\nNithya A. Ruff is the Head of Comcast’s Open Source Practice. She is responsible for growing Open Source culture inside of Comcast and engagement with external communities. Prior to this, she started and grew the Western Digital’s Open Source Strategy Office. She first glimpsed the power of open source while at SGI in the 90s and has been building bridges between companies and the open source community ever since. She’s also held leadership positions at Wind River (an Intel Company), Synopsys, Avaya, Tripwire and Eastman Kodak. At Wind River, she led a team of product managers in managing a world class embedded Linux distribution and was a key member of the Yocto Project advocacy team on the board. Nithya is a Director at Large on the Linux Foundation Board and represents community interests on the board.\n \nNithya has been a passionate advocate and a speaker for opening doors to new people inOpen Source for many years. She has also been a promoter of valuing diverse ways of contributing to open source such as in marketing, legal and community. You can often find her on social media promoting dialogue on diversity and open source. She has spoken at multiple conferences such as OSSummit, OSCON, All Things Open, SCALE, Grace Hopper, OpenStack, VMWorld, OS Strategy Summit and Red Hat Summit on the business and community of open source. In recognition of her work in open source both on the business and community side, she was named to CIO magazine’s most influential women in open source list. She was recently one of 4 people to win the 2017 O’Reilly Open Source Award for exceptional contribution to open source.\n \nNithya graduated with an MS in Computer Science from NDSU and an MBA from the University of Rochester, Simon Business School. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and is a proud mother of two daughters.
