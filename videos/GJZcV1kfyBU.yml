title: 'Flink SQL in Action - Timo Walther'
recordingDate: 1562764552
description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nSQL is the lingua franca of data processing, and everybody working with data knows SQL. Apache Flink provides SQL support for querying and processing batch and streaming data. Flink's SQL support powers large-scale production systems at Alibaba, Huawei, and Uber. Based on Flink SQL, these companies have built systems for their internal users as well as publicly offered services for paying customers.In my talk I will show how to leverage the simplicity and power of SQL on Flink. I’ll explain why unified batch and stream processing is important and what it means to run SQL queries on streams of data. Once we’ve covered the basics, I will spend the remainder of the talk demonstrating the capabilities of Flink SQL. We will explore different use cases that Flink SQL was designed for by running queries on Flink’s SQL shell. In particular, I will demonstrate the unified batch and streaming engine by running the same query on batch and streaming data and show how to build a real-time dashboard that is powered by a streaming SQL query, which continuously updates an external result table.\_\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
