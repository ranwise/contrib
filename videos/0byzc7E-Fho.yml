description: "DOES19 London â€” At Sky Betting and Gaming we've been on a DevOps journey since 2011. We've undertaken numerous \"DevOps Transformations\" and learned that this is an ongoing program rather than a \"Big Bang\" initiative. As the company has restructured in to agile autonomous tribes and squads, we've identified and reused a number of patterns and techniques as we've evolved our ways of working. This talk aims to share those learnings.\n \nHowever, unlike many talks at DevOps Enterprise Summit this talks focuses on the practical rather than strategic. It looks at how team structures have changed, the way work is managed, how we learn, how we own products/services and how we safely increase velocity. In addition to looking holistically at the whole company, we'll focus on one case study of how the Container Platform Squad has evolved from a small greenfield POC to be the platform of choice for many projects/products across the tribes. Covering how patterns have been applied from the rest of the business and how they solved many of the challenges faced during the squads' evolution.\n\nDevOps Transformation: A Case of History Repeating\n\nAndy Burgin, Platform Engineer, Sky Betting and Gaming\n\nAndy has over 25 years of industry experience and has been part of the team at Sky Betting and Gaming for 5 years.
