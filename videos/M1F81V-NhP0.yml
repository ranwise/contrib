description: "This is \"Stencil: a built-time approach to the web\". Sorry, we messed up the title of the talk in the intro. \n\nWe all know and love framework-like features such as hot module replacement, reactive properties, templating, CSS-in-JS, lazy-loaded bundling, etc. Stencil is a new approach, a build-time abstraction with framework-level productivity, that generates hand-optimized components using future-proof web APIs. Weâ€™ll discuss the architecture of Stencil and the innovations a compiler can introduce to your apps and design systems!\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/manu-martinez-almeida/stencil-a-built-time-approach-to-the-web.html"
