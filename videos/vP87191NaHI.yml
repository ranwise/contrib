description: "IoT Application Running on KubeEdge + ARM Platform - Xuan Jia, Edge Computing Architect & Bin Lu, ARM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWe think k8s will have broad potential sitting between IoT edge devices/gateways, edge nodes and cloud platforms. So, we focus on this domain. Our initial goal is to evolve k8s for IoT edge applications:   1, Supporting industrial IoT use cases scaling to millions of edge devices  2, Via Edge nodes, bringing computing closer to data sources. Anticipated benefits include reduce latency, high performance and improved reliability.  In this presentation, we will introduce and show our cloud-native broadband router CNF based on k8s edge computing platform.  Major features including:  1, Hardware: we will demo a personal and portable edge cloud. This cluster consists of 4~5 Arm boards.  2, Container orchestration: Kubeedge + K8s  3, Deployment: helm  4, Container: minimal size container build  5, CNF: distributed gateway  6, other features: cpu manager/device plugin/...  \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nruo"
