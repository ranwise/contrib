description: "This talk will explain how to create simple web apps and REST APIs using Flask and deploy them with AWS Lambdas (using Zappa). AWS Lambdas are the \"serverless\" offering of Amazon Web Services. They're cheap and convenient to get quick services deployed with minimum effort.\n\nDo you want to see a live example? We built an image color extraction service using scikit-learn (just KMeans). Check it out: https://colors.rmotr.com/. Do you know how much it took us to get it deployed? Minutes. It was just about building a couple of Flask endpoints, packaging the scikit-learn code and deploying it to the lambda. Here's the source code.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
