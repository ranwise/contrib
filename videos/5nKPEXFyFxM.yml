recordingDate: 1561714026
description: "ML.NET is still fairly fresh Microsoft venture into deep learning. It's written in .NET Core and a lot of good thinking went into it. It's definitely the best hope for .NET developers to do machine learning natively and easily incorporate it into existing apps.\n\nAnd to show its power we'll harness deep learning to help a metal band to get out of their rut by writing for them some awesome new riffs. \n\nFrom this talk, you'll learn how to use ML.NET, how some deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks work and how to write metal songs!\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
