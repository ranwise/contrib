description: "Exploiting Buffer Overflows on RISC-V - Christina Quast, None \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAlmost 10 years ago, work on the RISC-V ISA specification began. Since around a year, we had the first hardware showing up, and since this year, this hardware is even affordable. With this development, the first products and also the first exploits will show up.   This talk will give an introduction to the RISC-V architecture and how exploitation differs from Intel and ARM. Afterward, examples of how to overflow a buffer, create shellcode in assembler language, and finally, how to perform ret2libc are shown. Basic understanding of assembly and C is a plus.&nbsp; \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrsm"
