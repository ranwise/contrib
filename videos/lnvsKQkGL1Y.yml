description: "KubeEdge - Kevin Wang, Huawei \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubeEdge is recently accepted as a CNCF sandbox project. It is accepted as a Kubernetes based and cloud native reference architecture for IOT/Edge computing.  Since KubeEdge is opensourced, there are quite some companies, academics and community members who showed interests and started to contribute.  In this talk, Kevin Wang from Huawei will share the overall architecture/design and specially demo KubeEdge’s real life usage.  Besides, we’d like to invite participants in the room to share their usage cases, thoughts and suggestions on how to facilitate the contributions/collaborations.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrqV"
