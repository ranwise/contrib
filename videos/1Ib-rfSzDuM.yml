description: "The Enemy Within: Running Untrusted Code with gVisor - Ian Lewis, Google \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) ) \n\nContainers are a great way to isolate application resources but they can fall short when it comes to security isolation. How do you improve the security of your workloads without giving up the properties of containers that you've come to love? There are many approaches to sandboxing containers, such as virtual machines and unikernels, but which is right for you?  gVisor is a unique open-source sandbox runtime that allows you to run unmodified applications in containers with a higher level of isolation and low overhead. In this talk I will explore the container security model of gVisor and use cases for sandboxing containers. I will discuss various approaches and their tradeoffs before diving into the architecture of gVisor and how it differs from virtual machine based sandboxes. Finally, I will bring it all together with a demo of a minimal serverless platform using gVisor and Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrou"
