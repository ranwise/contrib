description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Azure SIG – Craig Peters & Pengfei Ni, Microsoft \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIn the SIG Azure Intro and Deep Dive, we’re going to tell you all about why SIG Azure exists and the team behind managing it. From there, we’ll talk about what’s happened over the last few releases, Kubernetes 1.14 and Kubernetes 1.15, as well as some of what’s planned for Kubernetes 1.16. Additionally, we’ll cover considerations for successful deployments of Kubernetes on Azure. Afterward, we’ll have a demo of provisioning Kubernetes on Azure, leveraging Cluster API for Azure, and discuss a little bit about why Cluster API is important to the ecosystem. Finally, and most importantly, we’ll talk all about some of the best ways to get involved with SIG Azure and all of the forums that we’re communicating on! \n\nhttps://sched.co/OJZe"
