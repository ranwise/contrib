description: "Speaker: Ritesh Mehrotra (SIA) & Noorulameen (Credit Suisse)\n\nRitesh is a keen web developer and agile consultant with Singapore Airlines.\n\nHe Spends most of his time in agile consulting and technical training with multiple teams, with a focus on microservice and micro-front end development. He is an advocate of XP development practices, and co-organizer of the popular meetup based tech community – “TechTalks”. On a leisure day, you might spot him with a camera on Singapore streets.\n\nNoorul works as a front-end development lead at Credit Suisse.\nHis interests are Micro Front-ends, Progressive Web Applications and recently started exploring React Native.\nHe is one of the co-organizers of an active meetup group “Tech Talks” in Singapore.\nWhen he is not programming, he likes to travel and play badminton.\n\nThe age of micro-frontends\n\nIn recent years, we have done well to evolve from the big monolith, hard to change products, to developing small, independent, specific and highly scalable solutions in form of micro-services. Though one area, that hasn’t witnessed the revolution as yet in the front-end, plagued by complex, unstructured and hard to maintain implementations.\n\nWon’t it be nice if you could develop front-ends with SRP, and as highly decoupled independent features that can be plugged with any web app, be it an age-old monolith, a SPA or PWA? Ever wondered if you could readily combine the powers of Angular, React and Vue in one single application?\n\nJoin us to discover the power of micro-frontends and know how?\n\nProposed Agenda: – What is micro-frontend? – The need for micro-frontend – Advantages and considerations with micro-frontend – Role of web components and custom elements – Micro-frontend design strategies\n\nEvent Page: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
