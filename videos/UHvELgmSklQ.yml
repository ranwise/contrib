description: "How John Deere uses Flink to process millions of sensor measurements per second\n\nThe John Deere data platform receives and processes millions of sensor measurements per second from machines around the world. In this talk, we'll discuss the importance of stream data processing and how we are using it to improve machine automation and to help our customers improve the efficiency of their farm operations. We'll review the evolution of our streaming data platform, discuss lessons learned along the way, and share why we chose Flink to solve some of our most difficult problems. Finally, we'll walk through one of our Flink applications in detail and share techniques that we use to process data at massive scale.\n\nFlink Forward San Francisco 2019\n#flinkforward"
