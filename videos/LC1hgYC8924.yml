After that we will review several common combinations of scaling patterns and analyze their fit for purpose in a given context.\n\nThe talk will be presented as a growth journey of a fictional organization, highlighting key scaling decisions and lessons learned as a result.\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
