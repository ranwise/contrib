description: "I got an idea to build a hand detection app that helps me with one of my bad habits. I am going to be using my webcam to detect whenever I have my hand near my face and then trigger an audio signal for me to stop.\n\nWe are going to use javascript and handtracker.js which is built on tenserflow.\n\nYou don't need any machine learning or ai experience for you to follow along this video so I highly recommend you to follow along.\n\nðŸ›´ Support me on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/dev_ed\nFollow me on:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/deved94\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/developedbyed/\nGithub: https://github.com/DevEdwin\n\nðŸŽµ Music:\n\nOutro: \nLAKEY INSPIRED - Me 2 (Feat.
