description: "Building a Powerful Edge Using Blockchain - Zhao Zhenlong & Jing Shuaishuai, TrustChain Technology Co., Ltd. \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThere is a key question how to build a powerful edge of IoT system. We considered a two-layer architecture which separates thinking and reflexing and edge plays a role in reflex center of human while Al is like brain. Further, a blockchain-base edge upstreams trusted data to AI system while smart contract with basic rules provides self-decision ability.   Zhenlong Zhao will introduce the architecture mentioned above especially how to build an edge-trusted, distributed-secure and smart-self-decided layer using blockchain. Key technologies in building Trusted-Access-Env which is responsible for identity recognition, invasion detection, data cleaning, security enhancement using vector-based portrait, Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone and byzantine consensus will be fully detailed by Hansom Jing. A complex case of data integration from various IoT networks using multi-chain will also be discussed. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrtV"
