description: "Despite being very new, spring boot has seen a spectacular start as an\namazing kickstarter for spring-based application. You can now start your project\nin a matter of minutes, not days! On the other hand, you're still using Java, with\nall its ceremony regarding code... Wouldn't it be great if we could pair Spring\nBoot with a powerful yet simple language? In this talk, I'll live code a Spring\nBoot application using Kotlin, the friendly language provided by JetBrains. Come\ndiscover how you can now cut through all the red tape and finally focus only the\nimportant stuff."
