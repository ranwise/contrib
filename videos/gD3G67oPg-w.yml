description: "Today I am going to start my series teaching CSS from beginner to advanced.\n\nIn this topic I will cover all the position properties in CSS. Position static, relative, absolute, fixed and sticky. \n\nLearn to position elements like a pro!\n\nQuick notes:\n\n▪ Position static: Is the default position for HTML elements, will not effect anything.\n\n▪ Position relative: Takes its initial position and can be translated from there on.\n\n▪Position absolute: By default it is positioned relative to its closest ancestor (usually the body tag). If you define position relative on a parent element then it is going to be positioned in that context.\n\n▪ Position fixed: Rips out the element from the document and fixes it to the viewport. \n\n▪ Position sticky: Switched between position static and fixed.\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nFollow my Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevEd94\n\nPlease watch: \"Should You Become A Software Engineer?\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_kTl0eIJ4A\n\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-"
