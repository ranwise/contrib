language: English
recordingDate: 1558036772
description: "Kubernetes has now gone past the early adaptors phase and it is entering mass adoption. Adoption translates to a focus on DevOps for building, deploying applications to Kubernetes cluster. Companies can ease into this adoption by defining well-defined CI/CD pipelines for deployments to Kubernetes clusters so that operations and developer teams can work together.\n\nIn this webinar, we will look at how Azure Pipelines is thinking about building, deploying and managing modern, microservices-based applications to Kubernetes. We will show how you can use a combination of different tools and services like Azure Pipelines, Prometheus, Terraform, Grafana, Azure Kubernetes Service or Google Kubernetes Engine to achieve this goal."
