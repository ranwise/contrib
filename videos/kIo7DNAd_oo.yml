description: "Infosec is a continual game of one-upmanship; we build a defence and someone breaks it so we build another one then they break that and the cycle continues. Because of this, the security controls we have at our disposal are rapidly changing and the ones we used yesterday are very often useless today.\n\nThis talk focuses on what the threats look like *today*. What are we getting wrong, how do we fix it and how do we stay on top in an environment which will be different again tomorrow to what it is today. It's a real-world look at modern defences that everyone building online applications will want to see.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
