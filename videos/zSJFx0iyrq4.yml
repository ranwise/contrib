description: With the Spring Boot stack you can kickstart your Spring project in a
  matter of minutes. For both developers using Spring and microservices adopters,
  Spring Boot has been a resounding success. Favoring Spring Boot over the traditional
  Spring Framework comes at a cost, you have to let Boot be in control and it might
  hurt when you decide to get back in the driving seat. Come and discover how auto-configuration
  and the different flavors of conditionals work through the creation of a Spring
  Boot starter. You’ll come away with an understanding of Spring Boot internals, how
  to debug better, and be able to develop your own starter.
