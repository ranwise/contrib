description: "Mental Health in Tech - Dr. Jennifer Akullian, Growth Coaching Institute \n\nAccording to research by Open Sourcing Mental Illness, 51% of individuals working in the tech community have been identified with a mental illness. This is disproportionate to the 20% prevalence in the general population. To compound the concern, many working in the tech community are at risk for burnout, a condition that often resembles mental illness. While lots of people in tech struggle with mental health, industry-specific research and advocacy in the community is disproportionately inadequate. For organizations, awareness and advocacy around employee mental health is crucial, after all, happy employees are more productive and less likely to leave their job. For employees who are struggling, it is important they know that they are not alone and there is help. This talk is focused on reducing the stigma around mental illness and expanding education and awareness into how to help yourself and others in your community. Jennifer will provide mental health background as she reviews the research pertaining to the tech community. Industry-specific burnout will be discussed and strategies for improving oneâ€™s experience or helping a friend or colleague will be examined. Participants will learn concrete steps for improving mental health in the workplace at an organizational, team, and individual level. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NyYU"
