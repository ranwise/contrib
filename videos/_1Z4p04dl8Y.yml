description: "!!Con 2019 - I made a game you play by riding your bike! by Em Lazer-Walker\n\nMaking games that interface with the physical word can be tricky!\n\nThis talk will discuss a game I built to be played on a Bluetooth-enabled stationary bike. We’ll talk about my journey fighting BLE standards, and figuring out how to squeeze as many novel forms of input as possible out of off-the-shelf hardware, such as using the motion sensors built into the player’s iPad to figure out when they were turning the handlebars of the bike!\n\nWe’ll also explore what it means to create games that use weirder controls than a keyboard and mouse or game controller. My bike game specifically has two different versions: one meant to be played at home by cycling trainers with their own hardware, and an installation version for exhibitions and games events. What does it mean to design a game as a training tool — where “success” means a high-engagement game whose players show steady progress over time — versus an installation art piece where “success” means a thought-provoking interactive artwork whose gameplay supports an underlying political statement?"
