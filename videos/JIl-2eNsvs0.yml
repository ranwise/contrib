description: "Open Source and Standards Collaboration - Craig Northway, Qualcomm Technologies Inc \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nRecently there is a significant interest and need for Standards Defining Organizations (SDOs) to also participate in Open Source projects. Companies need to manage their standards and open source engagements in a coordinated manner. This has caused Industry Standards Program Offices (ISPO) and Open Source Program Offices (OSPO) to interact more frequently. Qualcomm has a rich history in SDOs and more recently is a strong developer and contributor in mobile and connectivity related Open Source projects. In this presentation we will review what we have learnt from joint engagements and collaboration between SDOs and OS.    We'll discuss typical standards and open source organizations and processes and address questions such as: What can your ISPO learn from your OSPO? What can your OSPO learn from your ISPO? And how can these 2 organizations collaborate within your company? \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrtD"
