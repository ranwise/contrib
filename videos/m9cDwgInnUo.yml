title: 'Marco De Sanctis - Bring your ASP.NET Core solutions to Kubernetes in Azure'
language: English
recordingDate: 1561623569
description: "Containers are one of the major breakthrough in IT of the past few years, and promise to revolutionize the way software is developed and deployed. Thanks to the support in Visual Studio 2017, time has never been more favorable to adopt them in our technological stack. \nThis talk will showcase a possible approach to port an existing ASP.NETCore solution to Docker, demonstrating how seamlessly Visual Studio integrates them in the development experience, while still embracing the advantages of dependency management that containers make possible. \nAfter executing the solution locally on the development machine, we’ll explore which options we have in order to deploy it on Azure Kubernetes Service. We’ll show a possible example for a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps and demonstrate how we can integrate it with the PaaS offering in Azure, such as Cosmos DB and Redis Cache."
