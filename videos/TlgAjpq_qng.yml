recordingDate: 1559437896
description: 'We will go through the process of reversing two samples of live malware: the first is a Windows ransomware, the second is an Android malware. I will also demonstrate the tooling and resources necessary to identify, handle and understand a malware sample. The idea here is to establish the methodology of how to approach a malware sample rather than focus on the technicalities of the platform.'
