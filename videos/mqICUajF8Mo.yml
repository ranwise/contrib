description: "Speaker: Tai Shi Ling @taishiling\n\nUnit tests... API tests... UI tests... mocha... chai... jasmine... cucumber... enzyme...?\nWant to introduce test automation to your project, but not sure where to start and what tools to use? \nJoin this workshop!\nLearn strategies for planning your tests, bring your laptop for some hands-on on different testing techniques and libraries for testing the backend to the frontend on a RealWorld project, and finally let's hook your tests up to your favorite CI/CD!\n\nRequirements:\nBring a laptop. Have a recent web-browser, Git and NodeJS installed.\n\nShi Ling is the CEO and co-founder of UI-licious, a tool to help software teams rapidly test and monitor end-to-end user journeys for their web app. She's been building web apps since jQuery, obsessing over performance and padding, and these days testing and accessibility for the front-end. She can also do kung-fu, but these days she mostly code-foo.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/pl3n/"
