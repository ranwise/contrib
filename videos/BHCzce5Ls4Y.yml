description: "The purpose of this entertaining and educating session is to explain the MATCH_RECOGNIZE feature from the basics, step-by-step, with many examples, and by that demonstrating how powerful and useful it is, and at the same time eliminating the fear from what may seem at first as complex syntax.\n\nA new clause – MATCH_RECOGNIZE – was added to the SELECT statement in Oracle 12c, to allow recognizing patterns in sequences of rows.\n\nThis new capability is very powerful, and introduces a completely new (yet somewhat intimidating) syntax. It allows solving a variety of problems in a simpler way than before, and with better performance.\n\nIn this session we’ll focus on this new feature, understand its syntax (and see that it’s not as difficult as it seems), learn how to use it and see many useful examples."
