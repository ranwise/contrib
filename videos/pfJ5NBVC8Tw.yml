description: "Getting Started with Node.js - Justin Reock, Rogue Wave Software \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLearn to leverage the power of server-side Javascript with this Node.js introductory tutorial. We’ll dive into Node’s architecture and understand the build and dependency management systems involved. Several modules for Node will be demoed, and we’ll learn how to debug Node applications within an IDE. You’ll come away with an understanding of what sets Node apart from traditional Javascript, it’s inherently asynchronous and event-driven architecture, and take a look at some real world applications built on Node.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrs9"
