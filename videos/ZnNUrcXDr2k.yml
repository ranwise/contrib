description: ".NET Summit 2019, Minsk\nFreaky .NET Track\nGeneral Partner - ArasCorp Development Center (https://companies.dev.by/arascorp-development-center) \n\nLet's Talk HTTP in .NET Core, Steve Gordon\nThis session will focus on some of the improvements which have been released in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.1, such as IHttpClientFactory and the new, more performant socket-based handler. Steve will identify some HTTP anti-patterns and common mistakes and demonstrate how we can refactor existing code to use the new HttpClientFactory features. Next, Steve will demonstrate Polly; a fantastic resilience and transient fault handling library which can be used to make your applications less prone to failure. When integrated with the Microsoft HttpClientFactory; wrapping your HTTP calls in retries, timeouts and circuit-breakers has never been easier!"
