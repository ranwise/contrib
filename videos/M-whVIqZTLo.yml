description: "This talks covers everything Java developers need to know to get beyond the safe bubble of Java 8!\n\nIt seems like keeping up with Java nowadays is an enormous task. Gone is the era of big, delayed Java releases take many years. We’re now getting a new major release every 6 months. What’s up with that? You’re probably still developing on Java 8, even though Java 12 is already available.\n\nJoin this session to get an overview of what’s new in Java since Java 8. We’ll give an overview of the module system (Java 9), the local-variable type inference feature (Java 10) and the new HttpClient API (Java 11). Expect lots of advice on how to get from Java 8 to Java 11 and beyond. It’s time to embrace the newfound agility of the Java platform!"
