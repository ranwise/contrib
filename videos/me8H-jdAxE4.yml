title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Ben Kolera - The Reflex Architecture (Combo Talk)'
recordingDate: 1562878802
description: "Reflex-dom is a remarkably awesome way to write frontend web applications in Haskell. Reflex DOM is built from Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) primitives defined in a library called Reflex.\n\nWriting apps in reflex-dom is a little weird at first because it's a whole brand new paradigm to structuring your programs. Just like the jump from imperative programming to FP, jumping into FRP is a tricky process of rewiring your brain to fit the new model of thinking. It can be very difficult to appreciate the power and architectures that you can from this transition while you are still learning the basics, which naturally makes it difficult to be motivated to put in the work.\n\nThis talk intends to help break this deadlock by talking about some high level reflex architecture that should be very familiar to anyone who has built a Redux or Elm app before. We'll explore the mtl style constraints that reflex offers for state management and the awesome things that this means for your programs and ability to reason about the type signatures of your widgets. You won't come away from this talk an expert and ready to write a greenfield reflex app, but you should get an appreciation of the power reflex has to offer and a motivation to learn more!\n\nBen has been a fullstack engineer for a bit over a decade: starting off with humble beginnings as a Java and Perl developer. He discovered Scala and Haskell in 2010 via the BFPG and quickly began to realise how much less he had to worry about his functional programs compared to his traditional imperative ones. He has been trying to make his web development as functional as possible ever since: interested in things like Nix, Servant and Obelisk/Reflex-Platform.\n\nBen currently works at the Queensland Functional Programming Lab, whose job is to bring a Functional Programming competitive advantage to Queensland business by training, mentoring and applying engineering effort to remove common roadblocks to FP adoption.\n\nFor more on YOW!
