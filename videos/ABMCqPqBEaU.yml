description: ".NET Summit 2019, Minsk\nFreaky .NET Track\nGeneral Partner - ArasCorp Development Center (https://companies.dev.by/arascorp-development-center) \n\nArchitecture: The Stuff That's Hard to Change, Dylan Beattie\nIn this talk, Dylan will share his own insights into the idea of architecture as part of a software development process. We'll explore some popular architectural patterns and processes — and a couple of obscure ones as well — and look at how, and when, you can incorporate those patterns into your own projects. We'll talk about how the idea of software architecture has changed over time, and share some tips and advice for developers who find themselves working with architecture as part of their role."
