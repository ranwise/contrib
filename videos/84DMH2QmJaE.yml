description: "Виктор Грищенко\nJetBrains\n\nCode is hypertext\n\nCode is hypertext — even more so than the Web.\nCode is full of cross-references to variables, methods, modules.\nIDE is the browser for the Code Web.\n\nBut Code is changing: I edit version \"A\", version \"B\" is committed, version \"C\" is processed by the CI server, and so on.\nMy colleague looks at different \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\".\nEven the core of my IDE deals with multiple \"A\" versions, all at once.\n\nCode is versioned, distributed hypertext.\n\nWhat models and algorithms serve this Code Web?\nWhat the future might bring?\n\nhttps://codefest.ru/"
