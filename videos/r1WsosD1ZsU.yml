description: "Post-Mortem debugging is a really powerful technique that allows you, through the use of several tools, to take a memory dump when an issue occurs in your application and later analyze it offline. The talk will primarily focus on llnode and how you can use this tool to better understand why a Node.js process is behaving odd or is crashing.\n\nEVENT:\n\nAmsterdam JSNation Conference 2019 https://jsnation.com\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nThomas Watson\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
