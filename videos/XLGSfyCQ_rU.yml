description: "Intro: Virtual Kubelet - Sravan Rengarajan, Microsoft & Ria Bhatia, Microsoft \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nVirtual Kubelet is a newly inducted project in CNCF that allows Kubernetes clusters to scale efficiently to any cloud provider of their choice. This session will go through the architecture of the project, applicable scenarios with public cloud providers, and demos to burst out existing kubernetes clusters without adding additional infrastructure. The session will also go through existing Virtual Kubelet implementations, and how users of Kubernetes can utilize the providers. This includes implementations from AWS, VMWare, Azure, HashiCorp and more. If you want to adopt Kubernetes and containerization, but not deal with managing more infrastructure then this is for you. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrrT"
