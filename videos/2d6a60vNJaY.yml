description: "Flowchain - Building Distributed Network Storage Using Blockchain Technology - Jollen Chen, Flowchain \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFlowchain aims to implement a blockchain that can provide a distributed ledger technology for the IoT. Therefore, Flowchain already proposed the virtual blocks technology that can ensure chunked data transactions in a near-instant manner. With virtual blocks technology, Flowchain can integrate with IPFS and Hyperledger Fabric to develop a distributed network storage that can ensure real-time digital assets transactions and store verified transactions. In this presentation, Jollen will show the implementation of the described system using Flowchain, Hyperledger Fabric, and IPFS open source technologies. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrvX"
