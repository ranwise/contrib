language: English
recordingDate: 1559249429
description: "In search for a feature-complete solution that supports HA clusters, follows Kubernetes best-practices, and comes with a simple and declarative API based on the Kubernetes Cluster API, we could not find a single one that fulfilled our needs. Therefore, we decided to build KubeOne. \n\nKubeOne takes care of installing, configuring, upgrading and maintaining Highly-Available Kubernetes clusters. It works out-of-the-box on any cloud provider, as well as on-prem and in bare-metal environments. \n\nIn this webinar, weâ€™ll introduce KubeOne and show you how to get started.\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Shanghai June 24 - 26 and San Diego November 18 - 21! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects."
