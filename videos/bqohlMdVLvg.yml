description: "Model evaluation is arguably the most important step of the modeling process. As data scientists, we constantly make decisions based on these evaluations. Is model A better than model B? Will this model be profitable in production? Is performance in production declining? Model evaluation for humans discusses approaches for assessing our models practically in ways we understand.\n\nPractitioners who are relatively new to releasing models into production or a product are likely to benefit the most from this talk however data scientists of all abilities may find useful strategies to take away. The approaches that we will discuss serve better as a play book than a rule book and will help build confidence in your model throughout all phases of the business lifecycle from development through deployment.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
