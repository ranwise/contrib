description: "Extending Kubernetes with Storage Transformers - Andrew Lytvynov, Google \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nStorage Transformers are invoked by the kube-apiserver just before Kubernetes resources are written/read to/from etcd. Thus, allowing developers a final chance to apply changes to resources before they are committed to disk.     In this demo heavy session, we will review the architecture of storage transformers and outline the appropriate scenarios for using them as an extensibility point.    \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrnS"
