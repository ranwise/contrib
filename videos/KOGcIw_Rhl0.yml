description: "Introducing Kubeflow (w. Special Guests Tensorflow and Apache Spark) - Trevor Grant, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nData Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence has exploded in popularity in the last five years, but the nagging question remains, “How to put models into production?” Engineers are typically tasked to build one-off systems to serve predictions which must be maintained amid a quickly evolving back-end serving space which has evolved from single-machine, to custom clusters, to “serverless”, to Docker, to Kubernetes. In this talk, we present KubeFlow- an open source project which makes it easy for users to move models from laptop to ML Rig to training cluster to deployment. In this talk we will discuss, “What is KubeFlow?”, “why scalability is so critical for training and model deployment?”, and other topics.     \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrvp"
