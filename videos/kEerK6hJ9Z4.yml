description: "Spider - A Practical Journey of China Unicom’s Container Cloud Platform Network Redesign - 超胜 向, China Unicom & Sam Chen, Mesosphere \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nChina Unicom’s Spider solution supports heterogeneous deployment that can be deployed across physical server, virtual machine, private cloud and public cloud.  Spider supports multi-tenancy which can help realize network isolation for different business units and provides multiple ways of pod-to-pod network connection. Spider provides standardized IPAM interface which cannot only guarantee each container is assigned to a unique IP but also can support fine granularity subnet management, IP allocation and recycle. It also supports rich network policy that user can realize network isolation and limit network speed by setting these policies. The user can also adjust the policy at any time based on the requirements of the container’s communication or network speed. Spider supports both CNM and CNI, and is able to seamlessly integrate with mainstream container orchestration platform. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrtt"
