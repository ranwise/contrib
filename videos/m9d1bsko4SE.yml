Explore new facets of these time traveling rubber duck opportunities to increase their usefulness tenfold. Tools like templates, linters, hooks, and automation. Hear what Dr. Seuss can teach us about git, and don't miss the most helpful morsel of git customization around... how to open a new message in an editor other than vim!"
