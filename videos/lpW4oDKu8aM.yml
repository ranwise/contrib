description: "Kubernetes IoT and Edge Working Group - Steven Wong, VMware & Luwei He \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes describes itself as \"a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services\".  There are edge and IoT use cases that challenge some aspects of Kubernetes.  - Run Kubernetes full clusters at edge locations (e.g. retail store and remote branch office) under tight resource constraints  - Run containerized workloads at edge with a remote Kubernetes control plane at a cloud or central location  - Run devices using non containerized software at edge  This session will survey of some existing solutions in the edge and IoT space, covering how they address issues like security, messaging, resource constraints, data communications, application lifecycle management, etc. while working within Kubernetes limitations.  We will wrap up with a report on ongoing activity within the IoT Edge working group and details on how you can get involved. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrqt"
