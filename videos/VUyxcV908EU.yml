description: "DOES19 London — I know that 'why Culture Is Important For DevOps' talks are almost always rejected. This sounds like that, but it's deeper - I talk about experience with various (anonymised) clients of the IBM Cloud Garage, pitfalls they fell into, and how lean startup and extreme programming techniques helped.\n\nTales from the DevOps Transformation Trenches\n\nHolly Cummins, Worldwide Development Leader, IBM Cloud Garage\n\nHolly Cummins is the worldwide development practice lead for the IBM Cloud Garage. As part of the Cloud Garage, Holly delivers technology-enabled innovation to clients across a range of industries, from banking to catering to retail to NGOs.\n\nShe has led projects to count fish, help a blind athlete run ultra-marathons in the desert solo, improve health care for the elderly, and change how city parking works. Holly is also a Java Champion, IBM Q Ambassador, and JavaOne Rock Star. Before joining the IBM Cloud Garage, she was Delivery Lead for the WebSphere Liberty Profile (now Open Liberty).\n\nHolly co-authored Manning’s Enterprise OSGi in Action.\n\nShe is an active speaker and has spoken at JavaOne, Devoxx, JavaZone, JFokus, The ServerSide Java Symposium, JAX London, QCon, GeeCon, and the Great Indian Developer Summit, as well as a number of user groups.\n\nDOES19 London\nDOES 2019 EUR\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
