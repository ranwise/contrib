description: "Time flies when you’re having fun! It flies even faster when you’re having fun with friends!\n\nFrom the back alleys of Kuala Lumpur, to the sand dunes of the UAE – from the pristine streets of Singapore to the picturesque canals of Amsterdam, we’ve come a long way baby – and we’ve got a long way more to go!\n\nJoin me in this look back at over a decade of running this ‘thing’ called the Hack In The Box Security Conference – a hat-tip to those who’ve come, those who’ve stayed, and a peek at what crazy plans we still have in store.\n\nIf beginnings always hide themselves in ends, then let us begin! Are you ready?"
