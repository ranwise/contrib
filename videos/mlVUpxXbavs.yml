description: "If you are working with resources in Azure and don’t know Terraform, chances are that will benefit from this session. Terraform has made a lot of progress lately in terms of Azure-support and is ready to help you improve how you manage your Azure resources.\n\nThis session will introduce Terraform and give you a primer on how to use it. Azure Resource Manager is one of the alternatives to Terraform, and you will learn about how they differ and help you choose the right tool. The session will feature a mix live-coding and slides. You will get the most out of the presentation if you know a bit about Azure or Azure Resource Manager.\n\nI will share my experience with Terraform and Azure Resource Manager, which hopefully will make it easier to understand what might be the right tool in your context. Terraform is not perfect, and you’ll learn about some of the challenges you might face.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
