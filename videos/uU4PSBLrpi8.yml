description: "Hybrid Cloud and Multi-Cluster Service Connectivity - Sridhar Gaddam & Aswin Suryanarayanan, Red Hat \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHybrid Cloud is becoming a common deployment these days. When your kubernetes clusters are spread across a mix of on-prem/public clouds, and you want your cluster local services (i.e., non-publicly accessible services) to be made available to services in a different cluster, there are number of things to be considered like Cluster Connectivity, Service Discovery, Security etc.  In this presentation we would like to present a solution that is 1. Cloud Agnostic: works on both on-premise and public clouds 2. CNI Agnostic: works with any of the kubernetes CNI networking plugins 3. Tunnel Management and Health-check: includes mechanisms to connect two/more clusters and periodically perform health-checks 4. Service discovery and Service reachability: expose cluster-IP services to other clusters 5. Inter-Cluster Network Policy: provides mechanisms to explicitly allow/deny traffic \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrnt"
