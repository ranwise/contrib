description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nIf we want to truly encourage diversity in our industry, we are going to have to listen and respond to feedback from under-represented groups that challenges our assumptions.\n\nIn 2015, my previous employer Bytemark built a fully-anonymous recruitment process in order to help address issues of hiring bias and to try and attract a diverse range of candidates.\n\nYou might think problem solved.... but no!\n\nDespite introducing a supposedly better process, we still weren't receiving applications from a wide range of candidates.\n\nWe realised that in order to diagnose the issue, we would need to conduct user research.\n\nThrough speaking to these candidates, successful and unsuccessful, alongside undertaking research at conferences and with peers, we found that some aspects of our \"ideal\" process were actually put off certain candidates, especially women, from applying.\n\nIn my 10 minute talk, I will present some of our learnings from this research and offer examples of how they can be applied to any hiring process. I will also argue that in order to be a truly inclusive industry, we need to start gathering and really listening to feedback that makes us uncomfortable with the status quo.\n\nAbout Bethan Vincent\nBethan is Head of Marketing at Netsells, a Product Development Agency based in the beautiful and historic city of York.\n\nFormerly a senior manager at cloud hosting company Bytemark, pioneers of a fully-anonymous recruitment process, Bethan came into the tech sector after completing a degree in Medieval History and developing an ethical certification. Through her work on defining ethical business practices and inspired by her unusual journey into tech, Bethan has become extremely passionate about encouraging diversity (in all forms) and inclusiveness in our sector.
