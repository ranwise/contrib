description: "Build IoT Applications on a Serverless Platform Apache OpenWhisk - Ying Chun Guo, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nMany Serverless platforms use an event driven programming model. The event driven programming model makes Serverless ideal for IoT applications. Events can be found everywhere in IoT applications. IoT applications, built and run on top of serverless platform, can take big advantages of serverless.    Apache OpenWhisk is an open source event driven Serverless platform in Apache Foundation. This session will introduce the benefits of serverless, general scenarios to adopt Serverless in an IoT application, how to define customized events, how to build an IoT application on Apache OpenWhisk, and then show a live demo at last.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nruf"
