description: "Probabilistic programming is sometimes referred to as “modeling for hackers”, and has recently been picking up steam with a flurry of releases including Stan, PyMC3, Edward, Pyro, and Tensorflow Probability\n\nAs these and similar systems have improved in performance and usability, they have unfortunately also become more complex and difficult to contribute to. This is related to a more general phenomenon of the “two language problem”, in which performance-critical domain like scientific computing involve both a high-level language for users and a high-performance language for developers to implement algorithms. This establishes a kind of wall between the two groups, and has a harmful effect on performance, productivity, and pedagogy.\n\nIn probabilistic programming, this effect is even stronger, and it’s increasingly common to see three languages:\n\nOne for writing models\nA second for data manipulation, model assessment, etc\nA third for implementation of inference algorithms\nSolving this “three-language problem” usually means accepting either lower performance or a restricted class of available models and inference algorithms.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. The Julia language supports Python-level coding with C-level performance. In Julia, Julia’s own code is “first-class”: code can be pulled apart and manipulated as a data structure. This leads to an approach for high-level representation of models, with transformations and optimizations specific to a given model or inference family.\n\nThis is the approach taken in Soss, a small and extensible Julia library that provides a way to represent and manipulate probabilistic models. Inference methods in Soss can be developed completely independently and without constraints, allowing arbitrary algorithms with no inherent ceiling on performance.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to probabilistic programming, we will explore the approach taken by Soss, its current state, and the path forward.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
