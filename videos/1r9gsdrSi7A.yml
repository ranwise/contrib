description: "💛 Linode Cloud Hosting For Developers (Episode sponsor)\nhttps://linode.com/funff\nUse code FUNFF19 to get $20 credit on your new Linode account \n\nWARNING: Very much a DEV OPS episode! Mostly CONFIG and discussion! 😂\n\nWARNING 2: This is what REAL development looks like. NOT A TUTORIAL! 🙀\n\nMessing around with the Node and React app that is powering the Twitch overlay, with the goal of displaying Twitch subscriber notifications in the info/sponsor carousel. Explainiong the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) workflow.\n\n📝 Episode notes\nhttps://www.notion.so/maximumsheep/Episode-notes-0fe424fa6720424eaa881f75bb04909e\n\n⏰ Quick jump\n00:50 What we'll be doing in the episode\n01:42 Explaining what the app is, how it is built (a mess), and its challenges\n16:20 Lambda.js, how the app works with deployment on Zeit/now.sh and the token storage structure etc.\n23:23 Destroying ears for everyone by starting to chew gum 😋\n26:32 Showing how CircleCI works\n33:43 config.yml discussing the config setup with CircleCI and how it deploys to Zeit and manages keys and stuff\n42:15 The now.json staging config for Zeit deployment\n46:01 WRAPPING UP! Deciding what to do next together with chat!\n\n💛 Follow on Twitch and support by becoming a Subscriber\nWe record the show live Mondays 7 AM PT\nhttps://twitch.tv/funfunfunction\n\n💛 Fun Fun Forum\nPrivate discussion forum with other viewers in between shows. https://www.funfunforum.com. Available to patron members, become one at https://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\n💛 mpj on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/mpjme\n\n💛 CircleCI (Show sponsor)\nRobust and sleek Docker-based Continuous Integration as a service. I used CircleCI prior to them becoming a sponsor and I love that their free tier is powerful enough for small personal projects, even if they are private.

Quokka is the answer - use this link when you buy to let them know you came from here:\nhttp://quokka.funfunfunction.com\n\n💛 FUN FUN FUNCTION\nSince 2015, Fun Fun Function (FFF) is one of the longest running weekly YouTube shows on programming 🏅 thanks to its consistency and quality reaching 200,000+ developers.\n\n🤦‍♂️ The Failing Together concept is what makes FFF unique. Most coding content out there focus on step-by-step tutorials. We think tutorials are too far removed from what everyday development is like. Instead, FFF has created a completely new learning environment where we grow from failure, by solving problems while intensively interacting with a live audience. \n\nTutorials try to solve a problem. Failing Together makes you grow as a developer and coworker.\n\n📹 Each show is recorded live on Twitch in a 2-hour livestream on Mondays. The host, assisted by the audience, is tasked to complete a programming challenge by an expert guest. Like in the real world, we often fail, and learn from it. This, of course, reflects what the audience identifies with, and is one of the most praised aspects of the show. \n\n⏯ On Fridays, an edited version of the show is adapted for and published on YouTube. \n\nContent Topics revolve around: JavaScript, Functional Programming, Software Architecture, Quality Processes, Developer Career and Health, Software Development, Project Management"
