description: "Deep Dive: NATS - Waldemar Quevedo, Synadia Communications, Inc \n\nThe NATS project took a big leap in 2018 towards making it possible to be used as the core component build a global overlay network to connect services securely. In NATS v2.0, its feature set has been considerably expanded, some of these features include, gateways to create super clusters, decentralized management via JWTs and ed25519 keys for auth, subject based isolation using accounts, a new clustering protocol and system accounts for operators. In this talk you will learn how about the internals of many of these features, the current state of the project and what is the next in its roadmap. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPjx"
