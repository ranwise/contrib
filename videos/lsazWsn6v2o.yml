description: "Designing a place with a positive social purpose in mind it’s the ultimate goal since studies are showing that if social and community cohesion is strong, people’s health, well-being and daily quality of life can improve. Social relationships and networks play a crucial role in the way communities succeed overpassing everyday struggles and how they cope in crisis situations.\n\nIn the same time, we want to talk about how technology can help straighten the social dimension of communities and cities at the strategy and implementation levels.\n\nAlejandra Rivera - Erasmus Mundus 4CITIES Master student in Urban Studies (’19), she has a background in International Relations and Economics and has worked with various international development projects in the U.S. and Latin America. Her ongoing master thesis is in social innovation focusing on educational capacity building initiatives aimed towards social inclusion: cases are Medellin and Malmö. She is intrigued by the potential of social and technical intersections in community development, and advocates for people-centered urbanism to create ‘Compassionate cities’.\n_________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
