As a business, they are under increasing pressure to deliver digitally and maintain pace with a market of faster younger and more malleable competitors. Carl Molyneux will share how a DevOps approach has supported this transition.\n\nDevOps in a Windows (Enterprise) World\n\nCarl Molyneux, Lead Application Lifecycle Management Engineer, United Kingdom Hydrographic Office\n\nCarl joined UKHO in December 2015, with the mission to improve digital delivery using modern ways of working, process and tooling. This has been a journey for himself, his team and the wider UKHO over the last 3 years. This has involved them introducing CI/CD ways of working, moving from CVCS to DVCS, modernising our assurance processes and so much more.\n \nThe UKHO collects and supplies hydrographic and geospatial data for the Royal Navy and merchant shipping, to protect lives at sea.
