Just having some plain metrics and a log isn’t enough? You need to control the behaviour of your application at runtime? You do have some very special requirements for your monitoring?\n\nAfter this talk you’ll be able to integrate Spring Boot Admin with Kubernetes using the spring-cloud-kubernetes project and squeeze every bit out of the Spring Boot Actuator. Learn the basics of Spring Boot Admin and the pitfalls when running in a cloud environment. Get to know the advanced customization options to make your self-tailored solution a perfect fit."
