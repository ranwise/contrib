description: "A new web stack has emerged. A stack powered by modern browsers, API economy and Git based workflows. A stack that is not tied to specific technologies. A stack that takes into account both developer experience while building the application, and user experience when interacting with the application. A stack that delivers better performance, higher security, and lower cost of scaling for web applications.
