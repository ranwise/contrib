description: "Anomaly detection can help with fraud detection, predictive maintenance and cyber security cases amongst others. Next to this it can help on a meta level for other machine learning projects by detecting outliers during training or inference. One of the approaches to anomaly detection is called Isolation Forests. In this talk we will first go over the original idea of the isolation forest paper and a slightly more sophisticated extension called Entropy Isolation Forests. Isolation forests have a number of appealing properties with regards to intuition, parallelism and performance but the basic formulation is missing native support for categorical features and missing values.\n\nBy looking at the mathematical formulation and the reasoning behind it we will extend this approach to natively allow categorical and missing values. The goal of the talk is twofold; on the one hand an in-depth introduction to the class of Isolation Forests and on the other hand a look at the process of extending existing methods to suit the needs of your project. The concepts in this talk are accompanied with a GitHub implementation.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
