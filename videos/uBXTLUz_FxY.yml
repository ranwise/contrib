description: "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the integration of the physical world with the digital world using open standards, enabling us to build new classes of applications that help to make people safer, healthier, and better informed.\n\nWe need to turn our minds to solving the worthwhile challenges that are as-yet unsolved in these new classes of application; in doing so, we are solving problems that affect the vast majority of the world's population, for the physical world is where they live.\n\nMy objective in this talk is to show you how easy and rewarding it is to get involved with building the IoT, using some practical examples of technology along the IoT spectrum:\n\nA long-range radio modem for integrating remote sensing devices with the Internet.\nAn inexpensive image recognition module capable of tracking many objects at high speed.\nAn autonomous flying robot that can find a lost bushwalker and drop a bottle of water to them. This example will draw on my experience building from scratch a quadcopter entry for this year's UAV Outback Challenge (see uavoutbackchallenge.com.au).\nUsing these pieces of the IoT, I will show some examples and demonstrations of what can be done by applying and extending the technical skills you already have, by leveraging the very approachable open source hardware and software that's available. I'll include some pointers for what technologies to use and how to get started.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
