recordingDate: 1562659644
description: 'Understanding context is a key factor to set expectations, define appropriate strategies and achieve results in any kind of initiative. The Agile movement started 18 years ago with a simple sentence ''We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it''. Now the Agile movement grew way beyond software offering a new perspective to all kinds of organisations and businesses. To ensure the success of Agile initiatives, is critical for Agile professionals, enthusiasts and curious people to not only explore Agile but understand the Agility phenomenon itself. As a first step, many questions need to be clearly and consistently answered: What’s the difference between Agile software development and Business Agility? Why does it start in software? Why now? What’s next? Why organisations struggle implementing Agile? How can we make Agility happen? What does it really mean? As a result of my more than 13 years of experience helping organisations from more than 30 countries to implement Agile. I’ll give my answer to all this questions from a systemic perspective, based on the Integral theory, in the service of a pragmatic approach to understanding the Agility phenomenon. Furthermore I’ll explain a simple and practical tool for organisational management to design their own strategic planning and goals setting standards and enhance Agility.'
