description: "Docker is great for wrapping up your application with its environment, but until recently it’s not been a great experience for development. The new release of docker for mac and windows changes all that.\n\nI’ll show you how to take an existing application and get it running in a docker container, including live-reload. We’ll use docker-compose to link the rest of the application together, and set up a .dev domain for the full web experience."
