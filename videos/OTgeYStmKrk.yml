description: "Open Source Education: Take CNCF Projects as an Example - Wei Wang, East China Normal University \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) ) \n\nTechnology education in university is critical for our society. Not only the technology itself, but also how to take good use of it. Open source is not only code, software or project, it also a kind of humanity culture which can guide us to pursue scientific method, creativity and team spirit. In this talk, I will introduce how to use open source projects to help students to learn new skills and doing research in campus. We proposed a platform to help students to select proper project, to play a interested project in an easy way, and to contribute to the project by designing a tutorial course of a project. In this way, students can not only benefit from getting knowledge and skill from the community, but also can contribute to the community. We will take some CNCF projects (such as Envoy, Kubernetes, and containerd) as an example to show you our experienced scenarios in my school. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrmm"
