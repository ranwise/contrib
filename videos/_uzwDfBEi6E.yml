description: "Go FaaSter: Cold Start Optimization in a Serverless Platform - Scott Zhou & Yanbo Li, Tencent \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThere is an open secret in the Serverless industry, most functions start off cold, taking many seconds the very first time -- impacting the latency of many business critical applications.    Come to this talk, where we'll talk about how we are dramatically improving the cold start performance of the Tencent Serverless Cloud Functions(SCF) platform.    We'll talk about our SCF architecture -- including networking, infrastructure, and function deployments -- and the factors that causes cold start latency.    We'll then cover the architectural changes we're making that is improving cold starts. Including improvements to elastic network interfaces, migration from containers to micro VMs, function code deployment, and resource reuse.    Finally, we'll cover how combining ML with autoscaling can avoid cold starts alltogether. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrof"
