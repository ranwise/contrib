recordingDate: 1562393222
description: "The Trade Desk's Year in Flink\n\nAt advertising technology leader, The Trade Desk, we built a data pipeline with three distinct large-scale products using Flink. The keynote gives you a peek into our journey, the lessons learned and offers some hard-won tips from the trenches. Most jobs were surprisingly simple to build. However, we'll deep-dive into one particularly challenging Flink job where we learned how to synchronise/union multiple streams, both in terms of asymmetric throughput and differing lateness/time.\n\nFlink Forward San Francisco 2019\n#flinkforward"
