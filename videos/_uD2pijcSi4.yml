description: "Have you wondered how JS engines work? This past year I built an engine from scratch in Rust. It was fun, weird, exciting and sometimes exhausting. I will share my experience as well as what it is like to work on the specification, collaborate with TC39, and lessons from engines in use today.\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/jason-williams/lets-build-a-javascript-engine.html"
