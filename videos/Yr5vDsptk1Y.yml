description: "Some Lessons We Learned from Moving E-business Giant to Cloud Native - Lei Zhang & Siyu Wang, Alibaba \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMoving a global e-business giant like Alibaba to cloud native is never easy, it's still on going, it takes long time to complete, but it's worthy.  In this talk, we would like to share some lessons we learned from these efforts we made during last year from both technical and community aspects, specifically:  1. What is the main blocker for tech giant to move to cloud native? 2. What are main tech debts for giant like Alibaba? How we tried to fix them (partially)? Does it work? 3. What should we do if application management is totally different from Kubernetes in your org? Tips: CRD & controllers 4. Why predictability is critical for e-business? Is predictability out-of-box in Kubernetes? If not, why? How to fix it (maybe not)? 5. How to verify scalability issues in cluster of thousands of nodes? 6. Is it possible for an \"elephant\" team to dance with upstream community? How? \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrms"
