description: "IT Spring 2019, Minsk\nProduct & Data Track \n\nDo you need a data engineer? - Anton Zayniev\nDE team - plumbers of data pipes - how did we understand we require them at Wrike and the challenges we have had to solve: \nDE may provide a lot of value removing headaches from analysts or data scientists, but also they may actually add more pain creating overlapping responsibilities. \nDE function is under the radar during the business expansion that makes data engineering team arriving later, or even too late, but never at the time they're actually needed. \nDE courses have almost zero appearance in CIS universities which makes them Red List species in our IT habitat.\n\nVideo Partner â€“ AgileLAB (https://www.agilelab.org/)"
