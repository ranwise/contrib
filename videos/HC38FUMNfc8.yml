description: "There are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out. But things are changing, if you can do `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs` or make an API call, you can now do AI. In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI-powered APIs. You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.\n\nEVENT:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend Code Camp 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAsim Hussain\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video,\n\nCREDITS:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-fOxx_kT5OARG0KiksiCA"
