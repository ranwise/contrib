title: '#AskTHAT Live with Jeremy Foster - Boats, IOT, and Pie'
recordingDate: 1525371284
description: "In this ver. @csell5 talks to @codefoster about his boat. Jeremy and crew are taking IOT to the ocean, making his sail boat a smart boat. All you need is a little Raspberry Pi and 5v! #THATConference and #AskTHAT.\n\nJeremy is a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft in what we call the Commercial Software Engineering group, and I do a lot of presentations. I always say, the only thing I like more than writing code is\_talking\_about writing code. You’ve likely heard it said that the best way to learn is to teach, and that couldn’t be more true than with technical topics.\n\nYou can find Jeremy at http://codefoster.com."
