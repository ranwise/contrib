description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\n\nGraalVM is a high-performance runtime for dynamic, static, and native languages. GraalVM supports Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages. At the same time, it can run the dynamic scripting languages JavaScript including node.js, Ruby, R, and Python.\n\nIn this session we’ll talk about the performance boost you can get from running your code on GraalVM, look at the examples of running typical web-applications with it, enhancing them with code in other languages, creating native images for incredibly fast startup and low memory overhead for your services.\n\nGraalVM offers you the opportunity to write the code in the language you want, and run the resulting program really fast."
