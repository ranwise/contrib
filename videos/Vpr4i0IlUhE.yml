description: "!!Con 2019 - Custom Sudoku Books with Ruby!! and LaTeX!! by Geoffrey Lessel\n\nMy father loves sudoku puzzles and for a while, solved one every night before bed. For two Christmases in a row, I created a custom book of 365 sudoku puzzles for him solve. Each week’s puzzles were harder than the previous week’s and required more advanced solving strategies. We’ll travel through the world of sudoku puzzle generation, difficulty categorization, puzzle selection, and PDF layout all within Ruby and LaTeX."
