description: "Practicing Linux Crash/Panic Issue on Production and Cloud Server: Using Kdump + Crash - Ben Shushu, Running Linux Kernel Group \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWith the rapidly development of Internet in China, more and more servers and cloud servers deployed Linux systems, like Alibaba, Tencent. In addition, with the development of the Internet of Things and industry 4.0, more and more product development chooses Linux system as the basic platform. Although the Linux kernel is robust enough, the system crash will happen frequently.  The topic of this speech is to introduce some experiences and of kdump + crash in Linux crash issues on our production development and deployment. We will introduce 6 experiments:  Lab1: Panic caused by a simple null pointer  Lab2: Access list head linked list that has been deleted  Lab3: a crash issue on device driver  Lab4: How to find the value of local variable and parameter of function through call trace and stack  Lab5: step by step analyze a complex deadlock crash issue  Lab6: Recovery function call-stack manually. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NruN"
