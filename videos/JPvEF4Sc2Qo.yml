This talk will highlight the difficulties we've seen and suggest tips and tricks that we have experimented with to improve this.\n\nIn a recent internal company survey, we identified that one of the challenges our team experiences working remotely is the sense that we don't actually feel like we are part of a team. This has led us to consider how this impacts the work that we deliver as well as the detrimental effects on individuals within the team.\nOver the last few months, we have experimented with several different approaches to improve communication, grow trust and build team culture. In this talk, I will provide examples of the experiments that we have tried, describe the results that these have had and set the scene for where we might look to experiment further in the future.\n\nAbout Paula Kennedy\nPaula joined Pivotal in 2015 and in her current role as Director of Pivotal Cloud Foundry Solutions, EMEA she is focused on working together with clients to drive innovation, transformation and business outcomes.
