description: "Back in the early 2010's people were sending all sorts of tech trash into space using helium balloons and styrofoam boxes.\n\nA friend and I decided we wanted to do the same thing, but by making everything from scratch. All the way from the PCB's and antennas, down to the web API's and map applications to track it.\n\nAnd we... sort of made it.\n\nThis is a story about technology, friendship, and lots and lots of duct tape.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
