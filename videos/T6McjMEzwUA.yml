language: English
recordingDate: 1562145125
description: "Are you doing microservices? Got exhausted of slow REST? Got mad of unreliable gRPC? An answer is RSocket. RSocket in a new network protocol with reactive streams semantic. It will make your system super fast and resilie.\n\nThe new generation of cross-service communication is coming and called RSocket. RSocket is a new protocol that embracing Reactive Streams semantic into cross-service messaging. This protocol enables backpressure-control and allows building canonical Reactive-System. Even though the protocol offers asynchronous messages’ streaming, there have already been a few competitors in this area by that time. One of those competitors is well-known gRPC. In this session, we are going to learn why RSocket is innovation solution for cross-server communication, can we compare it with gRPC at all and if can, what are the key differences between RSocket and gRPC and why we have to start using RSocket today."
