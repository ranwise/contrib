description: "Open Source Community Development in Greater China - Richard Lin, Huawei & Yun-Chen Chien, g0v.tw \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe beginning of open source software is rooted in the community. Community begins with a developer willing to open source code to attract more developers to contribute together. Then, there is a community which can grow organically by contributors. Today, the rapid development of open source in Mainland China mostly comes from the efforts of enterprises, but the spirit of contribution and collaboration does not seem to be as strong as that of US and Europe. The two speakers of this talk, Richard and Yun-Chen, are contributors and community coordinators from communities in Taiwan such as COSCUP and g0v.tw. They will share the observation, experience and analysis of the bottom-up open source community buildings in Taiwan and Hong Kong as the best practice and examples of the operation and development of the community in mainland China. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrtG"
