title: 'Write your own domain specific language with F# - Mikhail Smal'
recordingDate: 1562581684
description: "F# is a powerful and expressive multi-paradigm language with high performance and focus on functional programming.\n\nThis language allows you to write code, which a non technical person would be able to read and understand. In this talk I will show you how to write your own strongly and statically typed DSL. With it you will be able to focus on business logic and not get distracted with \"keyword\" noise.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
