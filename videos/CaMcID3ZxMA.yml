description: "Full Title: Open-source City - Improving livability of the city using publicly available resources\n\nMore and more data is collected in the city everyday, this data can be a valuable asset to improve the quality of live of its citizens.\n\nPanorama images, information about energy consumption, number of cases of infectious diseases -- you can find it all at https://data.amsterdam.nl/. And if you don't know how to process or visualize this data, you can get some inspiration from one of the many repositories of Amsterdam https://github.com/Amsterdam/ or by this talk at PyData.\n\nBut What can I do with all of this data?!, you are probably going to ask. Well, with some of it, probably nothing more than find the closest beach to enjoy the summer. Have you ever wondered where the best summer spots in Amsterdam are located? You can find the suggestions of Amsterdam's citizens here: https://maps.amsterdam.nl/zomerplekken/. And would you like to know the exact locations of all windmills in Amsterdam? No need to look for that any further - https://maps.amsterdam.nl/energie_zonwind/.\n\nHowever, the municipality has been working on multiple projects that you can benefit from as a citizen, learn from as a developer or simply get inspired by.\n\nAnalyzing citizens' requests, optimizing garbage truck routes, battling parking problems and discrimination -- these are just few examples of the applications that the city is currently working on in a collaboration with students from different institutions, including the University of Amsterdam.\n\nIn this talk, we would like to share with you more details about these projects, the approaches we have chosen and the resource we are using.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
