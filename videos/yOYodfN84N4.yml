title: 'A Skeptics Guide to Graph Databases - David Bechberger'
recordingDate: 1562316019
description: "Graph databases are one of the hottest trends in tech, but is it hype or can they actually solve real problems? Well, the answer is both.\n\nIn this talk, Dave will pull back the covers and show you the good, the bad, and the ugly of solving real problems with graph databases. He will demonstrate how you can leverage the power of graph databases to solve difficult problems or existing problems differently. He will then discuss when to avoid them and just use your favorite RDBMS. We will then examine a few of his failures so that we can all learn from his mistakes. By the end of this talk, you will either be excited to use a graph database or run away screaming, either way, you will be armed with the information you need to cut through the hype and know when to use one and when to avoid them.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
