description: 'Spring Boot is a stack enabling you to kickstart your Spring application
  in a matter of minutes. It has been a resounding success among both developers already
  using Spring and microservices adopters. Favoring Spring Boot over the traditional
  Spring framework comes at a cost, though: you have to let Boot in control and some
  like to know everything what happens. Come to this talk to discover about auto-configuration
  and the different flavors of conditionals by creating our own Spring Boot starter.
  After this talk, you’ll be able to understand Spring Boot internals and develop
  your own starter dependency.'
