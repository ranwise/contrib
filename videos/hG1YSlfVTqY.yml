recordingDate: 1560764993
description: "Widespread container adoption leads to an old problem - security and day 2 operations. Harbor is a CNCF incubating open source registry that stores, signs, and scans container images for vulnerabilities. Harbor solves common registry challenges by delivering trust, compliance, performance, and interoperability, helping organizations deliver a consistent image management solution across a variety of cloud native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.\n\nIn this webinar, you will get an in-depth analysis of Harbor features and find out how to securely manage container images and Helm Charts using Harbor, creating a container strategy that helps alleviate the security and compliance burden and satisfies InfoSec needs."
