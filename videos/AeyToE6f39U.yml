Or resorted to saying “best practice” because you knew you were right, but couldn’t articulate why? We can solve both these problems with “dialogic teaching,” a cornerstone of modern adult-education theory. In this talk, you’ll learn how to go from monologue to dialogue. You’ll learn how to teach developers of all skill levels in ways that center their goals and let you learn from them too. You’ll learn how to practice technical leadership when you’re right – and how to practice it when you’re wrong."
