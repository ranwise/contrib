title: 'Serverless with Knative - Mete Atamel'
recordingDate: 1562051852
description: "When you build a serverless app, you either tie yourself to a cloud provider, or you end up building your own serverless stack. Knative provides a better choice.\n\nKnative extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components (build, serving, events) for modern, source-centric, and container-based apps that can run anywhere. In this talk, weâ€™ll see how we can use Knative primitives to build a serverless app that utilizes the Machine Learning magic of the cloud.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
