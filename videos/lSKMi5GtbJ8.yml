description: "Full title: Non-Code contributions: The hidden gem in Open Source Projects \n\nNon-code contributions, like project and community management, are essential to the healthy function of an Open Source project, however often times, they contributors who take on these tasks arent recognized nor made part of the key decision makers in a project. In this talk I'll cover success stories in not only recognizing but encouraging and empowering the recognition of contributions such as documentations, advocacy, community management and contributor mentoring. Ill also discuss best practices to incentivize these contributions and to use them as a bridge to welcome more diversity in your community.\n\nMore informations: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/19/session/non-code-contributions-hidden-gem-open-source-projects"
