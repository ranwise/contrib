recordingDate: 1561639301
description: "In this day and age, privacy is important to our customers, and it should be important to you as well!\n\nIn some cases, you're legally obligated to ensure your user's privacy and to protect their information, but it's increasingly becoming The Right Thing To Do (tm) as well. So how do we do it? Which traps lie in these waters? How do we, as developers, build solutions that protect our users from the start and all the way into the core of our applications. We'll go through patterns and techniques you can directly apply in your work, we'll talk about questions you should be asking your business and help you make privacy a feature of your system and not an afterthought. Without making your life needlessly difficult.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
