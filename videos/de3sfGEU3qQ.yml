description: "Panel: Edge Computing in the IoT - Tiejun Chen, VMware; Janko Isidorovic, Mainflux; Shane Wang, Intel; Changming Bai, Alibaba and Ivy Peng, IoT Think-Tank \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nOne key of the scenarios of edge computing is IoT. But we are trying to put Edge Computing into practice, it is easier said than done. Especially, while enabling it with edge network connectivity and different computing technologies for a variety of commercial IoT systems, we are facing many challenges of complexity at the edge.  In this panel, we will have several technical experts across different spaces to share:  1. edge computing vs fog computing vs cloud computing 2. use cases and killer applications 3. challenges, problems and benefits at the edge, especially in industrial area 4. open source solution, projects and consortium. 5. the LF Edge Projects hosted by Linux Foundation 6. open source edge in China and activity 7. Landscape  This panel will help get insights of IoT edge computing with several edge computing experts from VMware, Intel, Alibaba, LF Edge, etc. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrtb"
