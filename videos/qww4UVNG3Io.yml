description: "Two Years with Vitess: How JD.com Runs the World's Largest Vitess - Xuhaihua & Jin Ke Xie , JD.com \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nJD.com serves 99% of China's consumers, we have always had to innovate on infrastructure in order to meet the demands of scale and speed. In 2017, we adopted Vitess to help us scale MySQL. Two years on, JD.com now operates the world' largest Vitess on Kubernetes deployments. In this presentation, I will introduce how we use Vitess in JD.com. I will also share my personal understanding of Vitess in the Chinese context. Finally, I present a demo to show how we fully exploit the value of Vitess. My presentation will demonstrate: 1. The value that Vitess brings to JD.com: how we use Vitess to reduce costs on machines and development 2. Frequently encountered problems: as one of the world's largest Vitess users, we want to share the problems we have encountered with Vitess and how to solve them 3. Practical examples in my demo: how to quickly built our projects with reusable Vitess modules \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrpv"
