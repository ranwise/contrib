You’ll learn the motivation, core concepts and principles behind microservices, how they can help your frontend team work more efficiently, and the tradeoffs that are normally involved when you try to apply them to single-page applications. Luckily, Docker and Kubernetes can alleviate a lot of these issues, and we’ll walk through a minimal but concrete example of building a microfrontends architecture with these tools on your local machine. Finally, you’ll see how you could migrate gradually and what it takes to bring this architecture to production. No previous knowledge of Docker or Kubernetes is required.\n\n \nWhat are the key takeaways from this talk?\n- A real-life use case for microfrontends and motivation for adopting microfrontends (tech autonomy, reduced impact of failure, team independence)\n- Core concepts, principles, and prerequisites of microservices (highly decentralized, independent deployment, modeled after the business domain, and more), and the tradeoffs usually involved when applied to microfrontends (dev/prod parity, interactivity, iframes, developer experience)\n- Docker and Kubernetes/Helm fundamentals – the purpose of each tool and how they complement each other\n- A minimal but concrete example of how to implement a microfrontends architecture on their local machine with Docker and Kubernetes\n- How to migrate to this type of architecture in a gradual way and what’s involved in deploying this architecture to production\n\n\nMore:\n- \"Kubernetes for Application Developers\" - Matthew Palmer (Certified Course) https://matthewpalmer.net/kubernetes-app-developer/\n- \"The Container Operator’s Manual\" - Alice Goldfuss (session from LeadDev London) https://youtu.be/sJx_emIiABk\n- \"Introduction to Kubernetes Ingress\" - Jay Gorrel https://medium.com/@cashisclay/kubernetes-ingress-82aa960f658e\n- Local development against a remote Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence\n- Sample code:\nhttps://github.com/mlent/microfrontends-host\nhttps://github.com/mlent/microfrontends-fragment-node\n\n\nMonica (@monicalent) is the Frontend Lead at SumUp, a multinational fintech startup. There she leads a team of engineers distributed across three countries. Before moving to Berlin, she worked in domains such as natural language processing and cloud technologies.\n\nSign up for our Newsletter to receive preview-links every other Thursday starting 2019, April 04: https://js-kongress.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9c3420f6b5269855b07422fb5&id=f490a69da5"
