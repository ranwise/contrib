description: "Deep Dive: Helm - Matt Fisher, Microsoft  \n\nIn this session, we will cover the current status of the Helm project. We will focus on the changes to Helm's architecture in Helm 3, including the new security model, new chart features, and the Helm core libraries. We will also discuss changes that affect the chart ecosystem, including the move to store charts in OCI registries. Finally, we'll discuss how users can start trying out Helm 3 and how to get involved with the project. At the end, there will be an open discussion where Helm maintainers and contributors can come together to discuss issues that benefit from face to face conversations. \n\nhttps://sched.co/N4kz"
