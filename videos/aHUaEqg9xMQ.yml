description: "Full title: How to avoid delivery of unsanitary food with IBM IoT and Blockchain\n\n\nLack of visibility and transparency is a key problem in the supply chain. Even when data on the processes is available, it's not reliable enough to trigger concrete actions. Blockchain can help solve some of the key problems in the supply chain: visibility, optimization, and trust. It can ensure proper access control for data shared among participants in the supply chain. A supply chain with continuous, real-time access to reliable, shared data on a Blockchain can be optimized more efficiently than that of traditional supply chains. This session include also demo and examples."
