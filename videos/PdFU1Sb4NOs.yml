description: "!!Con 2019 - Learning to See in 4D by Omar Shehata\n\nIn this talk I’m going to teach you how to look at a 4 dimensional cube! We’ll use a 4D geometry visualizer I built on top of Three.js. Yes, your eyes can’t really see in 4D, but you can’t really see in 3D either and that hasn’t stopped you! Our eyes just see 2 dimensional images - it’s in your brain that the 3D scene is reconstructed. So there’s no reason you can’t do that for one dimension up.\n\nMathematically, high dimensional geometry has many useful applications. But I’m not going to tell you about any of that. I’m a graphics programmer - I just think it’s so cool that we can actually look at these objects! And in doing so, we learn a little bit about vision and perception."
