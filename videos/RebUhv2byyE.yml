description: "Exploring High Availability in Kubernetes with Vitess - Jiten Vaidya, PlanetScale \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nAs companies grow their infrastructure on the cloud in Kubernetes, questions of high availability arise. To be truly cloud native, you must be able to handle failure at any point in your stack.     Vitess has many features that can help in failure identification and handling, such as vtgate-as-proxy and data recovery through duplication (instead of backup).    Vitess also works with many third party tools like Prometheus for easy monitoring and observability.    In this talk, PlanetScale cofounder and CEO Jiten Vaidya will present the case for planning for failure. Using a live demo, Jiten will show how designing for high availability using Vitess allows you to prepare for risk, avert disasters, and recover from catastrophic failure. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrq4"
