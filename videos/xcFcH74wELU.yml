title: 'How I Automated My Barn...'
recordingDate: 1561356008
description: 'A few years ago I created a small system to automate some tasks in our barn where we keep pet potbelly pig and our chickens. Simple things, like scheduling when the lights turn on and off, temperature monitoring and a webcam. It was nice to automate those things, but the best part for me was being able to tinker with the sensors and devices and learn new libraries, frameworks, and languages. I’ve recently re-imagined the system as a way to learn more new technologies. I’ve created a prototype version to demonstrate how I might build it again if I were to start over from scratch and in this session, we’ll look at that model and learn about the hardware and software used in it. At its core, the system uses an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and various pumps, solenoids, motors, and sensors to simulate the automation of certain tasks like filling a water bowl, opening and closing doors, monitoring environment and turning on and off lights on demand or via a schedule.'
