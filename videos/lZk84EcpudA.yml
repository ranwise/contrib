description: "I'll talk about recent work parallelizing analysis of this data using a variety of distributed backends (Apache Spark, Dask, Pywren, Apache Beam). I'll also discuss the Zarr format for storing and working with N-dimensional arrays, that several scientific domains have recently gravitated toward in response to challenges using HDF5 in parallel and in the cloud.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
