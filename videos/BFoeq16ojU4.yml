description: "Keynote: Kubernetes: The Video Game - Grant Shipley, Director - OpenShift, Red Hat \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Kubernetes API is amazing and we are not only going to break it down and show you how to wield this mighty weapon, we are going to do it while building a video game, live, on-stage. As a matter of fact, you get to play along! The speaker in this session wanted to create a game and learn the kubernetes api. He thought this was out of his reach until he met the Javascript Phaser Game Engine and the Kubernetes API. In this session, Grant Shipley will walk you through the code he wrote to create a retro style Wild West shooter that manipulates Kubernetes resources as part of the game. This session will leave the slides at the door and will focus on code and live demos. At the end of this session, you should have enough knowledge to gamify Kubernetes or to at least automate it for real-world use cases. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrqA"
