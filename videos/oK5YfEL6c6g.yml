description: "During the last couple of years a lot of progress has been made in a number of NLP tasks. This progress is largely due to new deep learning methods that utilise ever larger data sets. Translating the research progress into new and improved products in industry is not always straightforward; there is often no direct link between an academic NLP task and some automation task in industry. In order to utilise the progress in academia, research engineers need to dissect the automation tasks into smaller pieces that can reasonably be mapped to the ones in academia...\n\nMore on Matti and his talk: https://bit.ly/2vhtb7S\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
