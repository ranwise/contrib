description: "Plan to Fail: A Good Captain Doesn’t Sail Without Life Rafts - Steven Wong & Carlisia Campos, VMware \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHistorically, formal disaster recovery (DR) plans were only feasible for large enterprises. They could afford to allocate time, resources and the cost of duplicating a datacenter infrastructure.    With the popularity of public cloud and cloud native technologies, the cost and complexity of DR planning has been significantly reduced. This means every company, large and small, can engage in business continuity planning. Why is this important? These are some of the reasons:    Machines and software fail  - People make mistakes  - Hackers prey on the vulnerable  - Weather, fire, terrorism, more...  - You lose customers when there are outages and data loss   - Legal standards often require data retention    This talk will focus on:  - Items that need to be backup and why - some might surprise you  - Why you need selective restore capability  - Existing tooling to simplify and automate a DR strategy \n\nhttps://sched.co/NroN"
