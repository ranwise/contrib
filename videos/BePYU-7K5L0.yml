Baidu, the Chinese search engine company has began to adapt innerSource .   As the leader of this project, I will talk about how   this happened, and what's the challenge we faced and overcome.  we need to set policy, define processes and enable tools to support it.  but the most important part is to cultivate open source culture.  And now, many projects inside Baidu has been adapting innerSource,  some of them have became mature and even donated to open source foundation,   for example , one project brpc has been an apache incubator project.  innerSource is a long journey, we need to improve it to support baidu's technical strategy. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrtA"
