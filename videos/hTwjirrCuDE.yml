description: "!!Con 2019 - Reverse engineering your mouth! by Evy Kassirer\n\nAs babies, many of us learn to talk by unconsciously figuring out how to move the muscles in our face. Let’s learn to talk again, but this time by looking into what’s going on under the hood!\n\nPink Trombone is a web tool that lets users create sounds by interacting with a virtual oral cavity, nasal cavity, tongue, and throat. Are those building blocks actually enough for speech, and can we teach Pink Trombone to speak English words? What sounds are especially difficult to produce - for humans, and in the app - and why? Join me in digging into the technology behind this app and learning more about how our voices really work."
