title: '#HITBHaxpo D1 - Hacking The 0day Market - Andrea Zapparoli Manzoni'
language: English
recordingDate: 1559437929
description: "The 0day vulnerability market developed in a way that is unsafe, chaotic and rather inefficient (business-wise). This inefficiency hampers the ability of law enforcement and intelligence to fight organized crime, terrorism and hostile geopolitical actors. Yet, engagement in the 0day vulnerability market is critical for information gathering and investigative activities.\n\nCrowdfense is “hacking the 0day market” in order to improve it for all involved (customers, integrators, brokers and researchers), by introducing new quality standards related both to products and services and to the underlying business processes. This session will share how Crowdfense is doing this and what innovation in the 0day market could look like."
