description: "In a business context, you frequently encounter text or document classification tasks. For example to determine whether or not an e-mail is a spam, or at ING Wholesale Banking whether or not an account name is that of a company or of a private individual. A successful approach is to train a classifier on character or word n-grams. But sometimes it also pays off to use certain regular expression patterns as features. For example to detect acronyms, legal forms or initials. The regular expressions we used were designed by hand, based on what we expected to find in the text. This made us wonder if there are maybe more regular expression patterns that we didn’t think of, but could be automatically learned from the data. So we set out to build an end-to-end machine learner, that combines genetic programming to build regular expressions, with a classifier based on the regular expressions’ matching. We will show the architecture of the learner, how it is trained using a distributed/island model, and how it performs on various data sets stand-alone and on top of character or word n-grams.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
