description: "App Operator: The Hidden Persona - Ria Bhatia & Sudhanva Huruli, Microsoft \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) ) \n\nAs enterprises look to deliver quality software as part of their business, two roles have been naturally created: the developer and the infrastructure administrator. Technologies such as Kubernetes have tackled the problem of managing the infrastructure. However, there is still a gap for how we manage applications on top of these systems. As a result, infrastructure operators and developers are forced to deal with concepts that are outside the scope of their roles. This talk will focus on the importance of having an application operator and the duties of this role in an enterprise embracing cloud native technologies. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrw7"
