Her aspiration is to help build stronger and happier communities around the world.\n \nShe has been leading diverse technology product portfolios and teams across many locations for Nike, Trivago, Tesco, Accenture and Facebook. She has a Master’s degree in Business Technology and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science.\n\nChris began his career at Nike 7 years ago as a software engineer and a champion of contract-first development.\n\nWith this previous background of building APIs for Video on Demand servers, he was positioned to build some of Nike’s first REST services used to drive digital commerce in new domains and experiences. As Nike’s focus on domain-driven microservice architecture grew, so did his responsibility within the organization where he went from leading development teams to building and supporting new development organizations to tackle large programs.\n\nA year ago, Chris was moved to Nike’s European Headquarters outside of Amsterdam to continue building Nike’s global development footprint and create a digital development organization. His teams at Nike’s European Headquarters now deliver global services and experiences for Nike.com and SNEAKRS.\n\nDOES19 London\nDOES 2019 EUR\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
