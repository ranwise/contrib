title: 'STORK, Storage Operator for Multi-Cloud Deployments'
recordingDate: 1562701108
description: 'STORK (STorage Operator Runtime for Kubernetes), an open-source project, leverages the Operator SDK to provide better life cycle management of your persistent data for your stateful application in Kubernetes. STORK addresses challenges of storage layer observability and volume level snapshots on a Kubernetes platform. The project has implemented a Kubernetes scheduler extension to influence how pods are scheduled closer to nodes with application data by implementing the Filter and Prioritize API calls. Dinesh will demo STORK, a storage driver agnostic implementation, by showing how you can take application consistent snapshots of your services running in Kubernetes. Dinesh will also show how you can use STORK to migrate your stateful application between Kubernetes clusters.'
