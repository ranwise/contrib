description: "Speaker: Ben Dechrai\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Identity and Security Meetup is an informal evening open to all. We start with food, drink, and mingling, followed by a talk. The evening ends with an optional networking session at a local venue.\r\n\r\n## Talk Abstract\r\nAuthentication for a simple site is easy. A user table with permission flags. Add scaling, a service-oriented architecture, and new technology stacks and you quickly introduce complexity. Learn how OpenID Connect and JSON Web Tokens make your life easy again!\r\n\r\nThis talk includes a history of OAuth and OpenID Connect, describes the login flow, and finished with a quick demo of what it looks like to use an off-the-shelf identity provider.\r\n\r\n## Speaker Bio\r\nBen Dechrai is a technologist with a staunch focus on security and privacy. This started at the age of 11 when he wrote software to stop his mum from breaking the family PC, and resulted in his working as a developer evangelist for Auth0. He enjoys helping developers find the joy of experimentation, from ethical skulduggery to subversive automation, and can be found on Twitter and Instagram at @bendechrai.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Identity-and-Security-Meetup/events/261756509/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/pesW/"
