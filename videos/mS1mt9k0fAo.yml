For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.  \n\nEdureka's Advanced Predictive Modelling in R course will cover different concepts of predictive modelling and almost all the forms of regression analysis with application. You will learn regression in detail including detailed understanding of various regression techniques using case studies. Also, you will be introduced to various other regression techniques which are used in industry. Overall, you will gain expertise in predictive modelling and forecasting. You will also get to implement one project towards the end of the course.                                     \n\nThe Topics covered in the webinar are:\n\n1.Advanced Predictive Modelling in R\n2.
