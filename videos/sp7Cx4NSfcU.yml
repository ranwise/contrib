description: "Speaker: Lin Han\r\n\r\nDespite countless debates, inline styling is still loved by many web developers. This talk will focus on a specific library (JSS) that is my favorite among the current offerings. It will demonstrate how I ended up using the library by demonstrating the problems I had with other CSS solutions and how I solved them with JSS.\r\n\r\nPresenter's bio\r\n\r\nLin is a web development professional at day and hobbyist at night. He doesn't have many commitments so he has tried many different types of stacks over the years. Now he is deeply in the camp of the React + GraphQL ecosystem.\r\n\r\nEvent Page:\r\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/261294292/\r\nhttps://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/259235995/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Huiren Woo\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/pW0n/"
