title: 'React Native Performance: from Rendering to Animations - Ilya Ivanov'
recordingDate: 1559828169
description: 'When building mobile applications performance is really crucial. If we compare React for web development with React Native, the latter is much more restrictive in the sense that performance mistakes are sometimes far more reaching, even taking into account the golden quote of Donald Knuth “premature optimization is the root of all evil”. This talk is going to provide a deeper dive into principles and practices of making sure your app behaves as fast as possible. We will look at the common mistakes of component design, which lead to performance degradation. How to make lists more performant and animations more fluid. I will also introduce some of the tools, which might help you discover bottlenecks in your application.'
