Taking care of existing data requires caution. Exploring and testing possible solutions can be slow. Your new data model may require data completeness or correctness that hasn't been enforced for the existing data.\n\nTo manage the risk and minimize disruption to the product roadmap, we broke the effort into four stages, each with its own distinct challenges. I'll describe our rationale, process ... and the lessons we learned along the way."
