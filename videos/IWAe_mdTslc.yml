description: "On the first episode of my educational podcast, I have a very special guest for you! Bryan Johnson is an entrepreneur and venture capitalist that sold his payments company, Braintree, to Paypal for $800 million. What makes him someone I admire is how he decided to use that amount of wealth to improve human life through Science and technology. He invested $100 million into Kernel, a neuroscience startup that he leads and another $100 million into OS Fund,  a venture fund that invests in scientist entrepreneurs. He's also an avid reader, which made for an amazing conversation. We touch on Artificial Intelligence, Science, mathematical mindsets, books, psychedelics, and so much more in this discussion.
