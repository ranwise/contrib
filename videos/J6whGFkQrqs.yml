description: "Virtualization, Automation and DevOps – Why it’s Taking so long for Telcos? - Anuradha Udunuwara, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTelecom industry has been talking about SDN, NFV, Cloud, Virtualization or what I call all of them  together as “softwarization”, for quite some time. But, except for few telcos around the world, most of  them seems to be struggling to achieve what was expected – “automation”. There are many reasons for  that – technical and non-technical. How to put virtualization, automation and DevOps in place and use  the tools like SDN, NFV, Cloud to achieve the ultimate objective of Digital Transformation – to become a  Digital Service Provider or Digital Lifestyle Service Provider or whoever you want to call? What were the  original roadblocks? Did we address them? What else need to be addressed to shorten the transformation  and start reaping the benefits? \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrvI"
