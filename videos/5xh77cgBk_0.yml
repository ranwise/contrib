The big advantage of the cloud and Kubernetes is that you can add and remove resources as needed. This also allow different strategies of handle the problems. However, there are challenges involved with stateful and long-running applications in cluster managers. This talk will discuss how to leverage tools to run big data jobs, such as Spark, Flink, and HDFS, in an on-demand way on top of Kubernetes. We also look at possible pitfalls, and ways of addressing them.\n\nTopics will include:\n\ndifferent opportunities in the cloud\nWhat tools can be used to help with deployment and management\nCluster auto-scaling\nDeployment of big data jobs\nTuning and optimization on big data and kubernetes side"
