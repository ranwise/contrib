description: "Design strategies for building infrastructure that can be continuously evolved, by using pipelines, automated tests, and loosely integrated stacks to enable a continuous flow of changes and improvements.\n\nPeople are adopting dynamic infrastructure technologies like cloud, containers, and serverless so that they can easily make changes to it. Defining infrastructure as code should make systems consistent, reliable, and easy to manage. But an infrastructure codebase can easily become a complicated, fragile mess that is scary to change. Teams can gain confidence to make frequent, rapid changes to continuously improve their infrastructure by applying appropriate design patterns and implementation practices."
