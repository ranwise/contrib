You need quick two-way communication between your client and server. Action Cable can solve that quickly, and get you up and productive with out setting up expensive external add-ons and complex integrations.\n\nThis magic is wonderful until you need to untangle how websockets, connections, channels, consumers, and clients all fit together. Let's look under the hood and see how everything is woven together."
