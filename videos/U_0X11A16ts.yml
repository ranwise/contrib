description: "Creating your First Smart Contract on Hyperledger Fabric! - Swetha Repakula & Morgan Bauer, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWhen one thinks of blockchain, two technologies that come to mind are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Much of the knowledge has been focused on public networks, and less is known about the permissioned blockchain platforms out there like Hyperledger Fabric. Fabric is an open source blockchain platform that has been designed for corporate use cases. Morgan and Swetha will go through the architecture of Hyperledger Fabric detailing the transaction workflow, consensus mechanism, and smart contract capabilities. They will demonstrate how and end to end application could work on Fabric and in the process they will also talk about the benefits of a permissioned platform. Attendees will leave with knowledge to start developing on Hyperledger Fabric. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrvR"
