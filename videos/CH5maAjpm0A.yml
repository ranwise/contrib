description: "Mirjana Andovska\nNetcetera\n\nContext: The missing ingredient in multilingual software translation\n\nAn important phase in multilingual software systems is text translation. Since same text may be used in different contexts, it is difficult to determine whether the translation is proper in the context of the environment in which the text is used. Sharing only text keys and values with translators usually is not enough. Simple screenshots showing only the text content, also didnâ€™t help in situations where text keys were re-used on multiple places, or when there are highly generic templates. Thus, I would like to present how we can use the automated end-to-end tests to deliver the necessary artifacts to the translation experts. These artifacts contain text keys, text values and also the context where they are used.\n\nhttps://codefest.ru"
