description: "With the emergence of functional programming in mainstream JavaScript, point-free programming style (also known as tacit programming) is gaining traction. If you ever used RxJS you'll know what I'm talking about...\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore the motivation behind it and discover some interesting consequences. After imposing a strict set of rules, we'll try and solve a small practical problem and see where does that take us. This talk is a mix of presentation and live coding with examples in JavaScript.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
