description: "!!Con 2019 - I Built an Artificial Pancreas! by Sarah Withee\n\nOne of the coolest open source projects I’ve seen in a while has been OpenAPS, the Open-source Artificial Pancreas System. It originally piqued my interest since I’m also a type 1 diabetic. Could a small hardware device really do the work of one of my organs? Was it safe? How’s it work? Could it be hacked? I’ll address all of these, as well as quickly show off my artificial pancreas, in this lightning talk."
