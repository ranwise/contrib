description: "OpenSDS: The Autonomous Data Platform for Cloud Native - Shufang Zeng, Huawei & Shane Wang, Intel \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe OpenSDS Project is an open source community comprising storage vendors as well as end users working to address storage challenges in the cloud native era. To date, the project has delivered an open cloud native storage platform that prevents vendor lock-in. As the community grows, expectations of the project to help accelerate data center modernization becomes greater. Providing northbound framework integration and southbound storage connectivity is just the foundation. The project needs to leverage artificial intelligence/machine learning, orchestration and automation, multi-cloud, etc. to work towards an open autonomous data storage platform. This talk will outline the development plan and end users scenarios. In addition, the talk will cover activities to cultivate the developer community, grow the ecosystem, and support end user adoption. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrsO"
