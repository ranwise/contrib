description: "IT Spring 2019, Minsk\nProduct & Data Track \n\n3 Stages of Growth - Chris Long\nGrowth is key for business success. Startups approach growth based on the classic pirate metrics funnel (AARRR). The funnel focuses on high intent traffic: users who have the intent or desire to use your product. But what happens when you run out of high intent traffic? What happens when growth slows? \nYou need to expand your funnel: go upwards and sideways. You can expand up the funnel by using branding and inspiration to market to folks with lower intent. Or you go sideways into new verticals. \nChris starts with the problem, and breaks down the solutions with some principles any organization can use to expand their funnel and find ways to keep growing. \n\nVideo Partner â€“ AgileLAB (https://www.agilelab.org/)"
