description: "This is a talk on failures of solutions: natural, artificial and \"intelligent\". It'll be a list of stories. Some of them will include: how I got an A+ for making the wrong decision on a thesis how a kaggle competition got hacked how DeepLearning nearly ruined a recommender how a redefinition of a problem saved people from hunger how a timeseries problem could not be solved until it got ignored My goal is to show that in order to solve a data problem, it might be good to take a step back once in a while and to try to see the bigger picture.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData Amsterdam 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nVincent Warmerdam\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w"
