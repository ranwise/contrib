title: 'Roland Guijt - When Azure AD is Not Enough: Creating a Token Service in ASP.NET Core 2.2'
recordingDate: 1560925883
description: "A big change in terms of security in ASP.NET Core 2.2 is that Microsoft is including the capability to create your own token service that supports OpenIdConnect. It uses the well-established IdentityServer framework as the basis for that.\n\nA token service enables you to do centralized authentication with single sign-on using industry standards just like Azure AD does. Azure AD is great as long as you don’t need customization beyond of what it offers. This is where creating your own comes in. I’ll show you the ins and outs of creating the service but not before I make sure you understand the terminology around it. Once you get the basics we’ll get into beyond the basics mode and I’ll show you some of the other marvelous things that a custom token service brings. After this session you’re ready to implement a token service in ASP.NET Core. And you will understand how to make us of the more advanced options."
