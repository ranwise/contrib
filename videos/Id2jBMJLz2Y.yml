description: "Learning a new language is often colored by the language you come from.\n\nAs a programmer coming from C++ and Java, with some functional programming background, how did I navigate trying to get a grasp of C#? Should be fun for C# developers, but also educational: How do we teach a new language to folks that already know how to program?\n\n\n\nDon't forget to check out Patricia Aas' next talk at this year's NDC Techtown:\nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
