description: "DOES19 London — Join us for a discussion on an approach for how regulated industries can implement DevOps to gain all the benefits of speed and agility - without introducing risk into the environments. We’ll talk about maintaining control and governance in a way that does not get in the way of development teams. This talk presented by Servicenow.\n\nDelight Your DevOps Teams By Accelerating Change\n\nEric Ledyard, Senior Manager, DevOps, ServiceNow\n\nW. Eric Ledyard is occasionally misrepresented as an industry thought leader in the world of DevOps. In reality, he’s just trying to figure it out like everyone else. That being said, he has been doing the whole “IT thing” for over 20+ years so he has picked up a lot of good wisdom along the way and is looking to share it. ;-)\n\nHaving started his career as a developer and IT leader, and having been an “Infrastructure Guy” for about 14 years - one day, He landed himself an “executive” position at a startup reseller. (CTO) It was at that time when other executives started wanting to talk to him and he was able to understand what their desires were from their IT organizations. It was all about driving IT as a competitive differentiator and not just a painful cost center.\n\nFrom there, he pivoted back to the world of Application Development and became an Executive at a big bank running a solutions architecture team trying to implement DevOps at a 200-yr-old bank.\n\nSince then, he has been continually trying to help drive the space forward with executives and with software companies alike. He currently works for a SaaS provider helping to shape the message of Enterprise DevOps for their customers.\n \n …Some would describe him as an oblong man, who likes toast.\n\nDOES19 London\nDOES 2019 EUR\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
