description: "!!Con 2019 - Tales from the Underground: Hilarious Cybercrime Fails!! by Pranshu Bajpai\n\nHilarity ensues as cybercriminals fail miserably in their objectives in these tales. Hackers have a fearsome reputation thanks to their sustained glorification in Hollywood. However, not all of these “l33T hax0rs” can boast real skill (…or any skill for that matter). A vast majority of these cybercriminals are script kiddies relying heavily on cargo cult programming and acquired tools. Surface level knowledge combined with the firm refusal to truly comprehend the tools being used, creates a perfect opportunity for comedic moments as these cybercriminals make ridiculous errors in design, operation and implementation."
