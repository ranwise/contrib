description: "DOES19 London â€” Based on his work with Fortune 100 enterprises, Dr. Mik Kersten presents a new concept, the Flow Framework, which unravels the enigma of enterprise software delivery, providing an approach that helps organizations better understand the human and system dynamic that underpins their IT infrastructure.\n\nProject to Product: Thrive in the Age of Digital Disruption with the Flow Framework\n\nDr. Mik Kersten, CEO, Tasktop\n\nDr. Mik Kersten spent a decade creating open source developer tools before realizing that programing was not the bottleneck of large-scale software delivery. Since that time, he has been working on creating a model and tools for connecting the end-to-end software value stream. Prior to founding Tasktop, Mik created the Eclipse Mylyn open source project as part of his PhD in Computer Science, pioneering the integration of development tools with the delivery pipeline. As a research scientist at Xerox PARC, Mik implemented the first aspect-oriented programming tools for AspectJ. Mik is the CEO of Tasktop and loves working with IT and thought leaders on transforming how software is built.\n\nDOES19 London\nDOES 2019 EUR\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
