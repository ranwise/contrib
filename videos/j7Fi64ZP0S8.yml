description: "Petter Måhlén, Infrastructure Engineer, Spotify\n\nMOBIUS - LOOPY UI ARCHITECTURE\nIntermediate / Android Architecture / Talk\n\nThis is a talk introducing Mobius, Spotify's open-source functional reactive framework for managing state evolution and side-effects. Mobius helps simplify writing testable business logic through enforcing separation of concerns, isolating stateful parts of the code and managing state changes sequentially and atomically. It also helps introduce a shared terminology between engineers and non-technical members of the team, simplifying collaboration."
