description: "Functional programming is regaining popularity in recent years, but to many, it still seems cryptic and foreign. \n\nIn this video, Amitay Horwitz demonstrates how functional programming can solve real, mundane tasks, like JSON parsing, in a simple and composable way, using monadic parser combinators.\n\nYou donâ€™t have to know category theory or what a monad is, in order to understand this video, but knowing Scala will help.\n\n* The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/amitayh/monadic-parser/blob/master/src/main/scala/amitayh/JsonExample.scala\n\n* For production use cases, Amitay recommend using something more robust, like Circe: https://circe.github.io/circe/"
