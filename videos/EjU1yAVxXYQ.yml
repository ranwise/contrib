description: "Porter - An Open Source Load Balancer for Bare Metal Kubernetes - Xuetao Song & Fang Du, Beijing Yunify Technology Co., Ltd. \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAs we know, the backend workload can be exposed externally using service of type \"LoadBalancer\" in Kubernetes cluster. Cloud vendors often provide cloud LB plugins for Kubernetes which requires the cluster to be deployed on a specific IaaS platform. However, many enterprise users usually deploy Kubernetes clusters on bare meta especially for production use. For the on-premise bare meta clusters, Kubernetes does not provide LB implementation. Porter, an open-source project, is the right solution for such issue.  This session will focus on the network technologies to help expose service and EIP management for bare meta Kubernetes \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrnw"
