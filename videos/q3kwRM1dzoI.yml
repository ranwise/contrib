title: 'Alissa Bonas - Introduction to service mesh with Istio and Kiali'
language: English
recordingDate: 1560852364
description: 'Istio and Kiali are new open source projects developed in Go that operate in the service mesh eco system. Istio enables users to run a containerized service mesh, while Kiali provides visualization and insights on top of Istio. In this talk Iâ€™d like to explain what service mesh is, and why Istio and Kiali are relevant to those who work with microservices and containerized environments.'
