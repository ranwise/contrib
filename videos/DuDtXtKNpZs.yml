description: "It is common to perform model selection while also attempting to estimate accuracy on a held-out set. The traditional solution is to split a data set into training, validation, and test subsets. On small datasets, however, this strategy suffers from high variance. A common approach to reusing a small number of samples for model selection is cross-validation, which typically is applied across an entire dataset. Then the best model is evaluated on the test set. This approach has a fundamental flaw: if the test is small, the performance estimate is high variance. The solution is double (or nested) cross-validation, which will be explained in this talk.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
