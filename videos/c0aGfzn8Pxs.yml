language: English
recordingDate: 1560816388
description: "Abstract:\nAre you still thinking about modernizing your database development process...someday...maybe? Do you have directories full of .sql files you use to build your application? You know that unit tests should be included as part of your build process, and you are going to start adding them...maybe next week? If you have an Oracle Cloud account, you may be surprised at what tools you already have access to and how easy it is to get started. This session takes a look at Oracle Developer Cloud Service. It discusses some of the included tools and explores mixing in some open source tools you can use to automate building and testing your applications. The sooner you get started, the more it will save you in the long run."
