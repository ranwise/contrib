description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nEver experienced that unexpected and urgent crisis that needs immediate effort and expertise? No matter how agile we are I'm willing to bet every team/project/organisation experiences these interrupts - the 'Black Swan' events - on a surprisingly regular basis.\n\nSo why don’t organisations plan for them? We can't predict what the interruption will be, so we can't put in place the right resources to deal with it, but a panic team pulled together at a moment's notice needs time to form before it can be effective - time we don't have.\n\nAre there any organisations out there that thrive on reacting to urgent interruptions? Yes. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), provides reactive Search and Rescue (SAR) response around the coast of the UK and Ireland. They respond to emergencies, launching state-of-the-art boats, with volunteer crews, into complex and evolving situations within minutes.\n\nSo how do they manage to create a team from a pool of volunteers in that timeframe? How do they compress Tuckman's lifecycle into minutes?\n\nI've been a crewman on lifeboats for twenty years and through this talk will explore the culture of the crews, what we can learn from them and bring into the workplace.\n\nAbout Steve Williams\nSteve Williams is a highly experienced engineering professional who has managed software development teams and built cultures in which they thrive for more than 15 years. Steve’s background, from being a developer in an Extreme Programming team in the late ’90s to embedded coaching in multi-national organisations, built his belief in Agile thinking and Lean cultures – leading to his founding of Expanding Box Consultants in 2017. Passionate about the environments in which great software is developed, Steve specialises in helping organisations adopt new techniques and tools. He firmly believes in encouraging curiosity, ownership and leadership at all levels."
