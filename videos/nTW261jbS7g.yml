description: "Recommended by Microsoft for creating mixed reality experiences for the Hololens, Unity has transcended its beginnings as a cross-platform game engine.\n\nSo whether you are looking to create a 3D game for mobile, or have your sights set on a virtual reality experience for the Oculus Rift, Unity is a tool you'll want to learn.\nOne surprise for C# developers getting started with Unity is the level of integration with Visual Studio and how simple it is to add C# code to manipulate their Unity creations.\n\nIn this demo led session, we’ll go back to basics with Unity, creating a simple 3D game with realistic physics, textures and explosions. We’ll look at the fantastic Visual Studio integration and how cohesively the two editors work together.\n\nFinally, we’ll look at a more complex 3D experience and how to use Unity's networking features to allow different users to interact in a 3D world.\n\nKeeping the best news for last: Unity is royalty free until you’re earning $100,000. So if you like the idea of becoming wildly rich from making immersive 3D experiences, this is the talk for you!\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
