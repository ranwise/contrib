description: "Manage Multi-tenant ML Workloads Using Istio - Wencheng Lu & Limin Wang, Google \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWith rapid growth of machine learning workloads deployed on Kubernetes, it is becoming a popular demand to offer a multi-tenant pipeline to manage machine learning workloads that facilitates different data scientists to collect data, train and serve models on kubernetes. Come learn how Istio can be integrated into a multi-tenant machine learning pipeline like Kubeflow to provide isolation and protection of workloads deployed for different users through sufficient identity, access, and api management \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrvs"
