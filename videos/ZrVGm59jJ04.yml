Based on my almost 20 years of experience in IT as operational DBA, developer and consultant I made couple of observation how to make professional life of DBAs, developers and consultants more efficient and avoid a common mistakes. Fast changing technology and more pressure from business brings a lot of pressure to IT which have to deliver project on time. It will is only possible if IT shops start using automation in every phase of work. I will show bad examples of work based mainly on Oracle technology which end up in an delayed project due to rework, misconfigured production environments and messy technology stacks which are very unstable. Each of the bad example will have a proposed solution which help to avoid similar issues in the future."
