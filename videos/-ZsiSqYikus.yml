description: "Speaker: Michael Schnyder (Zuhlke Engineering)\n\nMichael started his career as a Software Engineer.\n\nIt has made him understand how important feedback was for my growth. It’s crucial to find an environment that is strong on giving advice and let people coach others. A strong feedback culture is the key – technology can be learned easily.\n\nAccelerate your career by establishing a feedback culture\n\nDo you know what your co-workers value most from you? Do they give you advice where they see you in a couple of years? Tell you what you can improve?\n\nWe’ll have a look beyond code reviews and team retrospectives. Let’s look into techniques of giving feedback and how you can use your co-worker’s opinion as valuable career advice. Be warned as soon as you start asking for feedback you will learn a lot about yourself – and others want that too. Let’s also get prepared into giving valuable feedback!\n\nEvent Page: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
