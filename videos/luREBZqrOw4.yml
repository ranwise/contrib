This is a practical workshop where you'll learn \"hands-on\" by building several different applications from scratch using TensorFlow.js. If you have ever been interested in Machine Learning, if you want to get a taste for what this exciting field has to offer, if you want to be able to talk to other Machine Learning/AI specialists in a language they understand, then this workshop is for you.\n\nRequirements:\nBring a laptop. Have a recent Google Chrome, Git and NodeJS installed.
