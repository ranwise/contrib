title: 'Deep Dive Into React Native - Lev Vidrak'
recordingDate: 1559639520
description: "Wix Mobile Application is built with React Native, a cross-platform framework, allowing developers to compose mobile apps using JavaScript in a declarative way.\n\nScaling a production-grade application with such young framework without compromising on performance and dev velocity, forces us to deeply understand the internal architecture of React Native. \n\nIn this talk, Lev Vidrak starts with an overview of the React Native framework, following that, he dives into the main building blocks of the framework such as the Bridge, Native Modules, Metro Bundle and understand what really happens during runtime of our application.\nHe focues on the architectural bottlenecks of the system and explains how the upcoming re-architecture of React Native is going to solve these problems."
