description: "NFD and My Adventure in the Cloud Native Project Jungle - Markus Lehtonen, Intel \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAt its core, Kubernetes has a somewhat limited understanding of system details during operation. Node Feature Discovery (NFD) is an add-on that increases Kubernetes platform awareness by detecting and advertising the hardware and software capabilities of the underlying system. This information can be used to facilitate intelligent scheduling of workloads in a Kubernetes cluster. This talk introduces NFD and its role in Kubernetes. It covers the technical details of NFD, including how the node capabilities are advertised and how they can be utilized in workload placement. The presentation also covers my journey in the Kubernetes community and assuming maintainership of the NFD project. The journey passes through collaboration with third parties, both internal and external. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrn4"
