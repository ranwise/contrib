title: 'Building personalization with Orleans and Actor Modelling - Harald Schult Ulriksen'
recordingDate: 1561968965
description: "Everybody is different and with actor modelling we can treat each user in isolation without worrying about consistency, side effects or any other users.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at why we chose Orleans, an open source Virtual Actor platform for distributed high-scale computing applications, when building a new personalization platform for favorites and progress at tv.nrk.no and radio.nrk.no. We'll dive into how actor modelling is different and discuss some of the design decisions we made and look at how we implemented this in Orleans with f#.\n\nSoftware without a build pipeline and deployment strategy is not an option, and Orleans is no different. It takes care and planning, so we'll round off with a look at how we build with docker, deploy to Azure Kubernets Service and monitor with Application Insights to sleep well.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
