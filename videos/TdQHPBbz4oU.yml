description: "Ever wondered how companies delivering global services like Amazon or Netflix are architecting and testing their software systems? If you are curious and wanna learn how they do it, this session is for you!\n\nWe have traditionally built robust software systems by trying to avoid mistakes and by dodging failures when they occur in production or by testing parts of the system in isolation from one another. Modern methods and techniques take a very different approach based on resiliency, which promotes embracing failure instead of trying to avoid it. Resilient architectures enhance observability, leverage well-known patterns such as graceful degradation, timeouts and circuit breakers. In this session, will review the most useful patterns for building resilient software systems and especially show the audience how they can benefit from the patterns."
