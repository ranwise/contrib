title: 'How to develop your first cloud-native Applications with Java - Niklas Heidloff & Harald Uebele'
language: English
recordingDate: 1562837004
description: "For cloud native-applications, Kubernetes and Istio provide out-of-the-box a variety of key functionality that works generically for microservices, regardless of the language, they are implemented in and without changes to the application logic. However, some functionality cannot be covered by orchestration frameworks and service meshes. Instead, it must be handled in the business logic of the microservices, for example, application-specific failover functionality, metrics, and fine-grained authorizations. In this session, we'll use a concrete example to show how to create microservices with JavaEE and Eclipse MicroProfile and how to roll out and run them on Kubernetes and Istio. MicroProfile itself has some convenient features that are typically needed for the development of microservices, such as calls to REST APIs and implementation of REST APIs, including their documentation. For this session, we use our example code \"cloud-native-starter\", which we have released on GitHub as open source, along with scripts for fast deployments to Minikube and lots of instructions and information.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
