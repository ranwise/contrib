description: "The development of AI is creating new opportunities to improve the lives of people around the world. It is also raising new questions about the best way to build fairness, interpretability, privacy, security, and other moral and ethical values into these systems. This talk will highlight recent work and recommended practices for building AI that's fair and inclusive. Starting from Google's AI Principles, this talk will provide an overview of types of bias which can become embedded in machine learning systems. We will discuss how to design your model using concrete goals for fairness and inclusion, the importance of using representative datasets to train and test models, how to check a system for unfair biases, and how to analyze performance.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
