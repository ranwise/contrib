description: "Speaker: Ravi Kaklasaria - SpringPeople\n\nRavi is the co-founder and CEO of SpringPeople, a company that aims at disrupting the IT training industry in India. Created back in 2009, it was the first training company to partner with opensource tech companies such as SpringSource, MuleSoft, Elastic… While other companies were focusing on low price and quantity, SpringPeople was the only one focusing on high quality (which comes at a much higher price!). Ravi will explain how they have grown SpringPeople to a 100-people company, and how they have been able to protect their values while growing and how they have managed to remain a people-oriented company.\n\nSuccess – An Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n\nToday, we stand at the realm of exciting possibilities. With the fourth industrial revolution underway, the world is set to transcend all limits. Against this backdrop, the definition of success is continuously emerging. When we have achieved all that is out there to conquer, would we still be on the path to success?\n\nAs an entrepreneur, defining success and setting the right goals is critical to the wellbeing of the company and the team. So what constitutes success? Do tangibles such as money continue to be the yardstick of success? Does it lie in setting up a great organizational culture? Is it attracting top talent? Should it be revenue? Or is success best defined as a combination of all these factors & more?\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the new face of success for entrepreneurs as well as organizations.\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
