description: "Speaker: Sumit Chaudhari @sumit_nitsurat\n\nIn today`s world the front end technology is evolving really fast. New frameworks are getting launched to simplify the developers life. But with the changing technology it`s really hard to move from one framework to another or update to the newest version. \nWeb components is a relatively new standard enabling front end developers to create cross frameworks compatible components. it lets you write reusable components with native browser Api with zero external dependencies. \nIn this workshop we will learn to build a web app with reusable components using web components (custom elements, Shadow DOM, Html templates, Modules). We will also get acquainted with helper library lit-element and how we can integrate these components with existing frameworks.\n\nRequirements:\nPrior knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required in order to follow along.\nPlease bring a laptop, preferably with NodeJS and administrator permissions to install new software. Donâ€™t forget your favourite IDE for JavaScript development.\n\nSumit is a Software Consultant at Zenika Singapore. Curious and always interested in new technologies, he helps people to use the best practices known such as CI/CD, BDD, TDD, code reviews and so on. Sumit likes to share his knowledge with one and all via trainings, meet-ups and other tech events.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/pl3t/"
