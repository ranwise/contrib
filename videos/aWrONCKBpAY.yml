description: "!!Con 2019 - Compute geolocation from object shadows! by Jayesh Kawli\n\nInspired by the paper Determining the Geographical Location of Image Scenes Based on Object Shadow Lengths” by “Frode Eika Sandnes, I am going to talk about how geolocation can be calculated from object shadows. This method needs a simple setup and uses a mathematical algorithm to compute a rough geolocation of the place where the experiment is conducted.\n\nThrough this talk, I will share my experiences making a set up for an experiment just by using cardboard, a pen, and a 2-megapixel camera. We will also look at simple algorithms utilized to make geolocation computations along with cool plots and images. Finally, we will touch upon some of the things that could potentially be considered in order to get better and accurate results."
