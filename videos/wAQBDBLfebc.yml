description: "CNCF Storage Working Group - Xing Yang, OpenSDS \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe CNCF Storage Working Group and SIG collaborates to explore and understand how different storage technologies are used in cloud-native environments. Topics include block stores, file systems, object stores, key-value stores, and databases, amongst others. Different architectural approaches (centralized, distributed, sharded, etc) are compared in terms of key attributes like availability, scalability, performance, data consistency, durability, fault tolerance, ease of development and operational complexity.  In the intro, we'll provide an overview of the work currently underway and on the roadmap. You'll get the meet the people leading these efforts, and find out how best to get involved and contribute. We also welcome any other input you might have related to cloud-native storage.  Then we'll dive deeper! We'll present our work thus far, and host detailed discussions around the findings of our recent end-user surveys covering how cloud native storage is approached in the real world, including some representative successes and failures. Our hope is that others can learn from, and expand upon those experiences.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/O4X2"
