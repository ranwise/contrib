language: English
recordingDate: 1560796614
description: "Over the past few years, deep learning has given rise to a massive collection of ideas and techniques which are disruptive to conventional machine learning practices. However, are those ideas totally different from the traditional methods? Where are the connections and differences? What are the advantages and disadvantages? How practical are the deep learning methods for business applications? Chao will share her thoughts on those questions based on her readings and hands on experiments in the areas of text analytics (question answering system, sentiment analysis) and healthcare image classification.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
