description: "GraalVM native executable for real apps: using Quarkus to start your Java app in 10ms and 30MB of RAM\n\nSpeaker: Emmanuel Bernard (Red Hat)\n\nEmmanuel Bernard is a long time Open Source contributor and Java champion best known for his contributions to Hibernate ORM and Hibernate Validator as well as JPA and Bean Validation. He co-hosts Les Cast Codeurs, a developer podcast in French. Emmanuel Bernard is Chief Architect at Red Hat in the Middleware Business Unit. As Chief Architect, he oversees how data and middleware interact and is involved in Hibernate, Infinispan, Debezium (Change Data Capture) and more. To sum up, everything data.\n\nGraalVM native executable for real apps: using Quarkus to start your Java app in 10ms and 30MB of RAM\n\nMicroservices, rapid scalability and high density deployment platforms like Kubernetes require apps with low memory usage and fast boot time. Java had been the outsider in that universe due to its focus on throughput at the expense of CPU and RAM.\n\nNo more. Enter Quarkus, a microservices Java stack bringing your favorite libraries (Hibernate, vert.x, Camel, RESTEasy, Nettyâ€¦) to GraalVM and HotSpot with minimal memory usage and fast boot time. Enough to swim in containers like a fish in water. It makes GraalVM usable for real apps.\n\nCome discover GraalVM powers and limits and how Quarkus focuses on size and speed with no compromise on developer experience and ecosystem support. Since Quarkus is to be experienced more than talked about, expect a heavy demo session.\n\nThe next Java revolution is starting: come experience it.\n\nEvent Site: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
