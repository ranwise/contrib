description: "!!Con 2019 - Poeta Ex Machina! How To Teach Computers To Chant Latin Poetry! by Lee Butterman\n\nWe donâ€™t often hear Latin poetry! And there are lots of programs designed to synthesize human voices! We can piece together what we infer of how Latin poetry was pronounced and chanted to make a web app that recites Latin poetry on demand! We can start with freely available concatenative synthesis, with a few building blocks: determining basic pitch by word accent and volume of air in the lungs, freely available human voices from many languages, and a few hundred lines of code to glue it together. There will be audio from many different types of speech synthesis, and the web app is live at poetaexmachina.net !"
