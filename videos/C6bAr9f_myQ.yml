description: "Big Data and AI have unleashed possibility that was once a chapter in fictional stories. As these major tech revolutions take root in reality, we're faced with an interesting challenge to find convergence between the two. In this talk, I introduce a high-level architecture of how enterprises can make AI/Big Data a reality for their organizations.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
