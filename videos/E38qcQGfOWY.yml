description: "Consolidate Real Time and HMI with ACRN Hypervisor - Jack Ren, Intel \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) ) \n\nWith the increasing momentum of embedded devices getting smarter and always connected, it is prevalent to see that more and more industrial automation manufacturers (Siemens, Beckhoff, Inovance, etc) are combining multiple platforms (PLC, HMI, MC, Robotics, etc) into the the single products. The virtualization is the key technologies to empower such kind of the workload consolidation. However, one of the challenges is its strict Real-Time requirements. Some of the products need the Real-Time taskâ€™s scheduling latency to be less than 30us or even less.The traditional virtualization solution is unable to hard to achieve the Real-Time requirements above. For example, the KVM is only able to achieve 100us-level scheduling latency. This talk will present those challenges and how ARCN Real-time is designed to overcome those challenges and meet the industrial-grade Real-Time performance. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrui"
