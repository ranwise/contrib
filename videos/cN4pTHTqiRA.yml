description: "Wouter is a PhD student at the Control Systems Technology-group of the Eindhoven University of Technology. His main interests lie in the field of Systems & Control. His own research focuses on the development of optimal control strategies for greenhouse climate and lighting, aiming to reduce the environmental footprint of greenhouse horticulture by smart application of LED lighting. Three years ago, Wouter realized his dream by joining the robot soccer team of the Eindhoven University of Technology: Tech United Eindhoven. Now he is the team leader of the team, with approximately 15 robot-enthusiasts and more than six soccer-playing robots. Tech United Eindhoven is the current world-champion in Middle-Size League robot soccer.\n\nRobin van Perslucht is a professional soccer-playing robot, playing any position on the field. Often considered as the best player of Tech United Eindhoven, Robin has won four world titles and over 6 European and local awards. Born and programmed in Eindhoven, van Perslucht always dreamed of playing in the national team. Robinâ€™s main strengths on the field are his agility and his ability to oversee the game and strategy. Outside the field, Robin is an easy one, requiring only little maintenance and having surprisingly little demands with respect to income and types of lubricant.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
