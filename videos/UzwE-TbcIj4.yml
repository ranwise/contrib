description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Amsterdam 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOams\nhttp://gotoams.nl\n\nAnita Sengupta - Rocket Scientist, Professor of Astronautics and Space Technology University of Southern CA\n\nABSTRACT\nIn the global marketplace that transfers knowledge at the speed of light, we have a massive time delay that is modern transportation methods. We each spend up to 30% of our lives commuting on congested freeways, airports, and train stations. We put green-house gases into the atmosphere and change our climate with global consequences to health, habitat loss, and our economic future. On the cargo front this results in lost revenue, productivity, with no clear path to address the growing demands of the global market place.\nWhat if we could disrupt transportation, an aging and non-agile industry which has not seen a new mode in over 100 years. By introducing game changing technologies we can increase capacity, enhance energy efficiency, and shrink our carbon foot print. Dr. Sengupta will discuss how space-age tech coupled to the VC funded innovation environment are enabling the revolution in green transportation.\nShe will share her real-world engineering projects from her work developing the world’s first hyperloop in Las Vegas Nevada, to autonomous VTOL air taxis her new company is designing in Detroit Michigan, to her research on entry [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/756\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotoamst\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#SmartThings #FutureOfTransportation #VTOL #ASX\n\nVideo Credits\nASX: https://www.iflyasx.com"
