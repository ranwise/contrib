description: "Internet of Things (IoT) is possible because of the Internet, and wireless communication is what makes it easily deployable. This session goes into the fundamentals of radio communication, and why you need to know this even though you might be a software/test developer.\nWhy are there so many protocols and technologies and which is best? What the heck is \"link budget\" and how does that translate into range? What technology works through walls and why doesnâ€™t some? How can an IoT node operate for 15 years with only a coin cell battery as an energy source? This talk is a crash course into RF basics and wireless communication. In order to be the best software developer for an IoT solution, you need to have these basics. You will get a necessary understanding of system design beyond the software realm."
