title: 'Ludwig: A Toolbox for Training and Testing Deep Learning Models without Writing Code'
language: English
recordingDate: 1560524179
description: "Machine learning models perform a diversity of tasks at Uber, from improving our maps to streamlining chat communications and even preventing fraud. In addition to serving a variety of use cases, it is important that we make machine learning as accessible as possible for experts and non-experts alike so it can improve areas across our business. \n\nIn this spirit, we built Ludwig, an open source, deep learning toolbox built on top of TensorFlow that allows users to train and test machine learning models without writing code.\n\nTo explain how this powerful framework works, Piero Molino, Ludwig creator and Uber AI senior research scientist, discusses Ludwigâ€™s origin story, common use cases, and how others can get started with the software.\n\nLearn more about Ludwig by checking out the repo (ludwig.ai) and reading our article about the software on the Uber Engineering Blog: https://eng.uber.com/introducing-ludwig/"
