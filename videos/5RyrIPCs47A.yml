description: "GSAP Animation Tutorial | Create Awesome Animations With Javascript\n\nWe are going to cover how to create some pretty cool animations in javascript with a library called GSAP.\n\nWe can use GSAP to create more complex animations by sequencing them with TimelineLite. We are gain the benefits of cross browser support and high performance.\n\nGSAP is one of my favourite libraries to use to animate in javascript.
