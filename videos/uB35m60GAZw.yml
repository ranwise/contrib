description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\nSpeaker: Andreas Evers \n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/andreasevers/cutting-edge-continuous-delivery-automated-canary-analysis-through-spinnaker-spring-io-2019\n\nThe Spring team has been working on Continuous Delivery for a couple of years now. Spring Cloud Pipelines used to be Spring’s approach to deploy your applications into production, using tools like Jenkins or Concourse. However, those platforms’ key strength lies in Continuous Integration, and lack internal state representing the deployed landscape across clouds and regions.\n\nThat state is required to effectively perform deployment strategies, like cutting-edge automated canary analysis. Spinnaker’s autonomous judge, which analyses metrics of both baseline and canary deployments, drives deployment strategies based on automated data-driven decisions.\n\nSpinnaker is a stateful open source multi-region multi-cloud Continuous Delivery platform, fully written in Spring. It started at Netflix but now involves a wider community of contributors from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Pivotal, and many others. Pivotal Cloud R&D and the Spring Cloud team have been working on Spinnaker’s Cloud Foundry support and Cloud Pipelines compatibility for rollback testing and contract testing.\n\nJoin this talk to find out why Spinnaker is the Spring’s preferred Continuous Delivery approach and how it can bring your Spring application to production using cutting-edge strategies like automated canary analysis."
