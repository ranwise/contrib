title: 'How to Build a Bitcoin Startup'
language: English
recordingDate: 1562554626
description: "Healthpass is a secure cloud store for all your health records! This serves patients by giving them one place to store and view all of their health data across all providers globally. It serves providers by ensuring that health records are stored securely via a blockchain and allows them to see a patients previous health history easily. To build this app I used Node.js, Firebase, Bitcoin's Blockchain, Paypal, Stripe, Tesserect.js, BioBERT, and a health data visualization library called hFigures. The reason I built this app is to give you an idea on how a \"bitcoin\" startup would look practically, programmatically, and visually. I hope this inspires you to build something cool and even managed to fit a rap about SHA-256 into it.
