description: "Progressive Web Applications are a relatively new concept in the mobile and Internet world. PWAs are developed using specific standards and approaches to create apps that take advantage of both native and web application features. \n\nThanks to the concept of Progressive Enhancement they work no matter what browser you use. PWAs give users a great experience on every modern smart device – on the phone, tablet, PC, you name it. Even though they are ‘just’ web applications, PWAs act like a regular native app (with some limitations and device and OS differences of course).\n\nIn this talk, we will look at what makes a Web Application a PWA, why we want to do that and how we can do it with just web standards and some JavaScript magic."
