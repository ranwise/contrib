description: "Lightning Talk: Everyone Can Work on Kubernetes - Yang Li, The Plant K.K. \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)  \n\nMany Kubernetes end-users are eager to participate in the development of the project. However, Kubernetes itself can be intimidating for those that don't know where to start.    In this talk, Yang Li from The Plant will share his story of contributing to Kubernetes as a Chinese software engineer. He hopes to help new contributors start their journey. Yang will discuss how he began contributing to Kubernetes, what problems he encountered, and speak on what it is like to work with such a fantastic community. He will explain how end-users can benefit from contributing to the project, what he gained from this experience, and lastly, he will share some tips for those who want to start contributing.    Whether you wish to fix some bugs you have encountered, improve or localize documentation, or you need to work with Kubernetes as a part of your job, you will be welcomed in this community.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrro"
