Do you know how to foster a culture of psychological safety? What are you doing to be inclusive for folks who identify as trans or gender non-conforming? What about people with a disability? Or women of color?\n\nItâ€™s well-known that our industry has poor racial and gender representation, yet we need more action from that awareness. This talk is about leaning in, being an ally, and making an impact. It takes courage to be a champion of diversity, equity, and inclusion."
