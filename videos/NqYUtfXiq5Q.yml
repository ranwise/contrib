description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nScott M Stark - Senior Director, Software Engineering at Red Hat\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat if there was a way you could take advantage of the latest microservice architectures by leveraging the developers and skills you already have? What if you could do that with blazingly fast startup and crazy low memory consumption?\nIn this session we’ll show you how with Eclipse MicroProfile and Red Hat’s Quarkus. We discuss all the cool features it allows you to easily use, such as OpenTracing, and Metrics.\nThen we move onto a demo that showcases what’s possible with Eclipse MicroProfile, utilizing the existing specifications, running in Quarkus. We will develop a microservice that integrates all the specifications. By the end of the session the attendee will have a better understanding of Eclipse MicroProfile [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/878\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#MicroProfile #Quarkus #Microservices"
