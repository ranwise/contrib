description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\nSpring Framework 5.2 takes Spring 5’s common themes to the next level: embracing new reactive technologies such as R2DBC and RSocket through Spring’s transaction and messaging abstractions, and revisiting the core component container for GraalVM support and compile-time annotation indexing.\n\nThis talk focuses on core facilities for optimized application architectures in modern deployment environments, with support for Java as well as Kotlin, as a foundation for higher-level features in Spring Data and Spring Boot."
