description: "Rook Deployed Scalable NFS Clusters Exporting CephFS - Patrick Donnelly, Red Hat \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) ) \n\nRook was developed as a storage provider for Kubernetes to automatically deploy and attach storage to pods. Significant effort within Rook has been devoted to integrating the open-source storage platform Ceph with Kubernetes. Ceph is a distributed storage system in broad use today that presents unified file, block, and object interfaces to applications.  This talk will present completed work in the Ceph Nautilus release to dynamically create highly-available and scalable NFS server clusters that export the Ceph file system (CephFS) for use within Kubernetes or as a standalone appliance. CephFS provides applications with a friendly programmatic interface for creating shareable volumes. For each volume, Ceph and Rook cooperatively manage the details of dynamically deploying a cluster of NFS-Ganesha pods with minimal operator or user involvement. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrpy"
