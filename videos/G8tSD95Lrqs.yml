title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Susan Potter - Growing A Functional Discipline'
recordingDate: 1562619600
description: "Adopting functional programming in an existing software development organization is plagued with difficulties. Challenges include how to manage, maintain, and evolve existing systems with your new vision in a sustainable way while building expertise in a systematic functional mindset.\n\nThis talk reviews some of the lessons learned over several years of growing a functional discipline at primarily mainstream approach organizations to building backend services and infrastructure in Scala and Haskell to satisfy business needs where mainstream software development approaches were failing to produce.\n\nTechnical leaders, engineering managers, and individual software developers should expect to learn some approaches to:\n- reducing risks associated with introducing new methods to an organization\n- growing a learning culture from the ground up with support from the top\n- transitioning from ad-hoc workaround-based implementations with example-based usages to more defined understanding of the problem domain by considering domain and system properties and translating that from business to code at multiple levels.\n\nSusan Potter's academic background is quantitative in nature. After graduating the University of Manchester with a BSc in Mathematics, she worked for two global investment banks in London, then decided to move to San Francisco to build a B2B trading platform at a software startup in 1999.\n\nSince then she has led projects and programs at a leading global hedge fund and a US investment bank (both in Chicago) providing advice and leadership on front-, middle- and back-office trading system analysis, architecture and development.\n\nMore recently she has been leading efforts on software delivery pipelines and multi-tenant system and application architectures for SaaS (Software as a Service) and media/publishing companies leveraging both in-house and public cloud providers such as VMWare, Amazonâ€™s AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure as well as mixed datacenter/cloud infrastructure settings.\n\nFor more on YOW!
