description: "Lightning Talk: Back From the Future: A Time Traveler's Take on Serverless - Yunong Xiao, Tencent \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)  \n\nI've been to the future, and have seen a Serverless world where cloud and infrastructure are accessible to everyone, not just those with computer science backgrounds -- helping to level the playing field and allowing everyone to leverage the cloud.    Join me for a recap of my trip where I cover what's possible when you never have to worry about infrastructure, operations or even execution limits! A world where your entire business runs Serverless, not just peripheral event-driven tasks!    No more fiddling with uncomfortable APIs or misusing API Gateway just so your functions can stay warm! The future of the cloud is now! \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrru"
