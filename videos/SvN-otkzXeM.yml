title: 'DevOps ICU: Improving DevOps Results by (Correctly) Integrating UX - Debbie Levitt'
recordingDate: 1561364828
description: "UX is driving you crazy, a black throwing off timelines and killing ideas. UX doesn’t seem Lean or Agile. Can’t anybody make wireframes? Can’t we circumvent or exclude these people?\n\nDevOps is truly about so much more than how developers connect with IT, how infrastructure is managed, and how frameworks can be improved. It’s about recognizing how many teams are truly involved in the software development process and finding better ways to make sure everybody is at the table.\n\nThis session will explain how the UX process fits into Agile; saves companies money; augments DevOps goals; and increases customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
