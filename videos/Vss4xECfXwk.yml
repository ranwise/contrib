description: "Enhance the Web Chat from Slack. Our aim tonight was to have users displayed in the chat message similar or same as in Slack.\nWe run into a few logical issues, one that really gave us a good challenge. The longer the battle with React and JavaScript, the sweeter the victory.\nWe've used Balsamiq to create the mockups. We followed it by adding \"styled-components\" and \"moment\" to our ReactJS application.\n\nWe usually have fun with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, GraphQL, Git and many more"
