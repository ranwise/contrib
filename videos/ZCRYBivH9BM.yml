title: 'Fabulous – F# for cross-platform mobile apps - Don Syme'
recordingDate: 1561730193
description: "In this informal talk, I will describe Fabulous, a community-developed framework using F# to build cross-platform mobile and desktop Xamarin apps.\n\nCome and learn how this radical new approach to app programming makes your code simpler, more testable and helps avoid repetition. By embracing the React-like MVU architecture, you can do away with your Xaml, your behaviours, your converters, your templating, your MVVM and embrace the simplicity of functional model descriptions and view re-evalaution. I will talk about the concepts involved and how this differs from Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), the tooling available and how yuo can get involved.\n\nThis is mostly a conceptual talk and won’t be full of sparkling demos: demo apps are available from the Fabulous community.\n\nNote, Fabulous is a community project and is at version 0.34 as of May 2019. It is not a supported product or framework from Microsoft.\n\nhttps://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
