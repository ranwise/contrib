description: "How to Make Smart Cities Stay Smart with Open Source Projects - Yoshitake Kobayashi, Toshiba Corporation \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPower plants, radar systems, traffic lights, communications and weather systems are ingrained in our every day life. Many of these infrastructure systems exist for decades, if not longer, so security and longevity are paramount. Currently, all of these systems are built from scratch, with little re-use of existing software building blocks, which drains resources, money and time. It also leads to fragmentation and duplication of effort.    Civil Infrastructure Platform (CIP) aims to speed implementation of Linux-based civil infrastructure systems, build upon existing open source foundations and expertise, establish de facto standards by providing a base layer reference implementation, and contribute to and influence upstream projects regarding industrial needs.     \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrsF"
