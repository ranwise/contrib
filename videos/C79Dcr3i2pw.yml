description: "Microservices for the Masses – Integrating a Distributed OS with Kubernetes - Quinton Hoole, Futurewei & Irene Zhang, Microsoft Research & University of Washington  \n\nWe discuss our experiences integrating an open source distributed operating system (Amino) with Kubernetes to make reliable distributed microservices much easier to write. Writing reliable distributed microservices is notoriously difficult, even with Kubernetes help. In the absence of a coherent and cohesive set of standard open source distributed computing primitives available across all programming languages, things get really hard. We take for granted standard primitives provided by Linux like file systems, virtual memory, threads, network sockets, and locks. Without them, modern application development would be almost impossible. Yet distributed systems require different primitives for things like consistent replication, sharding, distributed shared memory, load balancing, failure handling, and auto-scaling. What should these primitives look like, and how do they work? \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXr"
