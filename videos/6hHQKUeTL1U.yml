title: 'Anvil: Full-stack Web Apps with Nothing but Python'
language: English
recordingDate: 1561246713
description: "Building for the modern web is complicated and error-prone: a typical web app requires five different languages and four or five frameworks just to get started. Wouldn't it be nicer if we could do it all in Python? With Anvil, you can design your page visually, write your browser-side and server-side code in pure Python, and even set up a built-in database in seconds. In this talk, Meredydd will walk us through how Anvil works under the bonnet, and the challenges of building a programming system that's easy to use without sacrificing power.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyCon SK 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMeredydd Luff\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4jGdbxnJqI"
