description: "The Python programming language has been around for over 20 years but recently it feels like its an overnight sensation. Python has moved from being a fringe language for beginners, biologists, and natural language analysis to being the go-to language in nearly every domain of computing. Whlie there is a lot of inertia in the choice of a programming language for a project, the adoption pattern of Python is quite different than \"that cool new language that came out a few years ago\". While most new programming languages are exciting for early adopters, by the time they are a few years old, many early adopters have moved on to the next big thing and the languages never find their way into the mainstream. Python seems different - Python seems to have a solid and continuously growing market share - and in particular Python seems to invade and take over application areas previously dominated by well-established technologies. We will look at some of the inherent aspects of Python that make it \"sticky\" - once you go Python you rarely go back or go anywhere else. \n\nEVENT:\n\nOpen Apereo 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nCharles Severance\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nFor the full video, go here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TgZVacgGs"
