description: 'The 2019 Scrum Master Trends Report by scrum.org and the State of Agile 2018 shows numbers that provide insight in the maturity of agile adoptions. More than 80% of the companies claim to be in or below a ''still maturing'' level. With Scrum being the industry standard (at least in western Europe it is), these numbers are surprising. In this overview of iterations towards Scrum maturity I describe the characteristics and main challenges to overcome in each maturity stage. This overview might help you as a Scrum Master or leader to assess your current situation and show you a direction in which you might find a solution for the problems you are facing implementing Scrum.'
