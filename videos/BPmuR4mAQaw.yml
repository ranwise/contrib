description: "Remember loving to read comics on a Sunday afternoon when you were a kid? Maybe you don’t. In the past, traditional print comics have made it impossible for blind and visually-impaired readers to experience their heroes’ adventures first-hand. Today an increasing number of initiatives like comic book stores for the blind aim to overcome this challenge.\n\nWhat if I told you that the web platform empowers us to even create comics for literally everyone?\n\nAlongside a demo application, you see how accessibility best practices enable you to craft an immersive webcomic experience that is not only engaging for the sighted but accessible for everyone.\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/jessica-jordan/crafting-comics-for-literally-everyone.html"
