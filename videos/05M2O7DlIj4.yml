description: "Uncertainties are invaluable for decision making. Say you expect 10 people at your dinner party but it could easily be 8 people more, then the amount of food you prepare is completely different than if it could only be one person more. In sciences, especially physical sciences, it is common practice to estimate uncertainties on your predictions, in the form of e.g. errors, intervals, or limits. Yet in data science these are not commonly seen. In machine learning (ML) problems one often calculates global uncertainties, namely performance estimates such as precision, recall and AUC. However, estimating uncertainties on individual predictions is uncommon whereas both in a business setting, where your machine learning model is used in a production environment, as well as during exploratory analysis, when determining the viability of a project/model one could use such uncertainties for decision making. The shortage of tooling for this purpose has inspired the ING Wholesale Banking Advanced Analytics team to create a Python library for estimating uncertainties and make them part of common (machine learning) algorithms, like regressors, classifiers and neural networks. The package can be found at: https://github.com/faab5/errortools/.\n\nIn this presentation we explain the mathematics that allows one to make statistical uncertainty estimates for models that minimize a loss function. Calculating uncertainties on predictions is split into two steps: estimating statistical uncertainties on model weights and propagating these to predictions. We show common approximations that can be made in both steps that allow one to make fast or even analytical calculations. We demonstrate by means of examples how one can use our package to incorporate uncertainty estimations in their daily machine learning practice. Finally, it is shown how these uncertainties turn out for several common machine learning algorithms and how we visualize the evaluated uncertainty estimates.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
