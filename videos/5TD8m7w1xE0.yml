description: "The domain of Payments, Finance, and more generally FinTech, is a fast-growing industry that reached record global investment of $111.8B in 2018. The underlying technology that powers this incredible growth is also evolving rapidly. Hosted by Uber, MoneyCon 2019 brought together engineers from leading tech companies to present on the latest topics in payments engineering.\n\nUber's payment platform is a set of microservices connected with streams. During Uber MoneyCon 2019, Uber engineers Emilee Urbanek and Manas Kelshikar discuss some of the challenges we face in operationalizing this architecture and discuss the solutions we developed to address them, thereby building a more reliable payment system."
