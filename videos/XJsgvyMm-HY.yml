description: "You may have heard development teams talking about the number of deploys they make a day or the number of PRs merged a day. You may have heard marketing teams talk about the number of page views a day. What do these metrics even mean? Are they actually useful to the business as a whole?\n\nIn this talk, Paul will debunk the idea of “vanity” metrics and why using these as a guide to success has only one outcome. This is a talk intended for all parts of an organisation to really help understand what metrics can do for us and why a metric may not mean what you believe it does\n\nBehind every vanity metric is a real metric that can help us understand the health of our company - whether it be the ability to understand our users or the ability to understand the value of a feature\n\nWe just need to step back and think about what it actually is...\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
