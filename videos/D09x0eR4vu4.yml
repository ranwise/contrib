description: "AIOps: Anomaly Detection with Prometheus and Istio - Marcel Hild, Red Hat \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAs IT operations become more agile and complex, at the same time the need to enhance operational efficiency and intelligence grows. Monitoring applications and kubernetes clusters with Prometheus has become quite common. Yet identifying relevant metrics and thresholds for your setup is getting harder.     In this talk, Marcel will show the tooling used to collect and store metrics gathered by Prometheus for the long term. Then analyze those on a large scale for extracting trends and seasonality but also forecasting of expected values for a given metric. Finally, he will integrate the predicted metrics back into the Prometheus monitoring and alerting stack to enable dynamic thresholding and anomaly detection.    All done with no more than OpenSource tooling and a fully working demo utilizing the instrumentation available in Istio.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrvj"
