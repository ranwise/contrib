description: "Deep Dive: Jaeger – Steve Flanders, Omnition \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nThis session will provide a deep-dive into the Jaeger project and the power it provides for distributed tracing data. Some quick background information will lay the foundation to discuss advanced topics including adaptive sampling, multi-tenancy, persistency tradeoffs, analytics and more. Demos of recently added features, integrations with solutions including OpenCensus and solving real-world problems with distributed tracing data will be shown. After this session, attendees will better understand the value Jaeger provides and be ready to make contributions to the project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/OGle"
