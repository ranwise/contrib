description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/mkheck/spring-security-for-n00bz-a-quick-introduction-for-the-terminally-insecure\n\nGirHub repo: https://github.com/mkheck/spring-security-4-n00bz\n\nNo one wants to be the next Equifax (or Target or Yahoo or TGX or or or) and feature prominently in headlines of the latest terrible security breach. Often referred to as a Career Limiting Move (CLM), it can also make you and your organization a target for lawsuits, federal charges, and recognition of the most negative kind. But security is hard, right? Where does one even begin???\n\nOne fully open-source solution for application security is widely used and respected: Spring Security. Built with Java & Spring, it provides a proven app security platform that integrates with numerous languages and components to provide end-to-end security for your critical applications. Using the JavaScript framework du jour for front end development? Reactive systems? LDAP? OAuth2? OpenID? It’s in there.\n\nDefense is a multi-faceted topic, but your application’s security is central to it all. Come to this session for a thought-provoking introduction to defense in depth and a live-coding “lock it down” exploration of how to secure your apps now and maintain their security over time using 100% open source software."
