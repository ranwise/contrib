description: "In my journey as a new participant in the Open Source world, Ive seen that Commercial Vendors often times contribute to OSS projects and get burned, sometimes for bragging to much about contributions and others for not preparing their employees to be good citizens when they play the game. Ive worked with my employer to develop tools and platform that help our employees be good OSS citizens but also effective employees, starting to enjoy contributing to Open Source and integrating their efforts to a healthy career development.\n\nhttps://berlinbuzzwords.de/19/session/playing-fair-open-source-world"
