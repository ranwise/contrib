description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nAntifragile - Designing the Systems of the Future\nBased loosely on the book ‘Anti-fragile’ by Nicholas Nassim Taleb, we look at how his theories on fragility and the ability to withstand shocks can be interpreted to help us design, produce, and manage better systems that can help us deal not only with failures, but also with rapidly changing markets and expectations in modern software development. We look at how we can combine Complexity Science and Systems Engineering to produce solutions that can both respond to change and provide quality.\n\nBiography\nBarry is a CITA-P certified Architect who has held Chief Architect positions at Microsoft and and iDesign. He has also been a startup CTO, the Worldwide Lead for the Solutions Architecture Community at Microsoft, and founder of the Swedish Azure User Group. He is also a trainer for IASA."
