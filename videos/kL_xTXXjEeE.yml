description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\nThis talk is a live coding where I will show how to gradually transform a Spring Boot application developed with Java, annotations and JPA to an idiomatic Kotlin application that will leverage Coroutines, WebFlux, Kofu configuration DSL (from Spring Fu incubator) and R2DBC (Reactive SQL).\n\nI will introduce the official support for Coroutines in Spring (Framework, Boot, Data) as well as Kofu, the Kotlin DSL developed in the Spring Fu incubator I have created a few months ago. It allows to configure Spring Boot applications explicitly and make them even more efficient."
