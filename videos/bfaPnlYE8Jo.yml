description: "SVG Morphing Animation With Javascript Tutorial | Javascript Animation With Anime.js\n\nIn this video we are going to cover svg animations and how to work with anime.js to create a simple but cool svg morphing animation by turning a sun into a moon! I know...bonus will be dark mode.\n\nThere are several libraries out there for svg morphing and svg animations in general, the best one out there would be GSAP which can be used for free however their morphing svg plugin is paid so we will use anime.js morphing to achieve this effect.\n\nThe benefits of GSAP's morphin SVG is that you don't need to have the same amount of points. In anime.js you are limited to only the same ammount as your other SVG so please keep that in mind!\n\n‚ù§Become a patreon for exclusive videos and more!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/dev_ed\n\n\nüìî Materials used in this video:\n\nAnime.js \n\nüõ¥ Follow me on:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/deved94\nGithub: https://github.com/DevEdwin\n\nüéµ Music:\n\nLAKEY INSPIRED - Me 2 (Feat.
