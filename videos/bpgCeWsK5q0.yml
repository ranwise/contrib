description: "Install \"Hardware Wallet\" for Consortium Blockchain -- Protect Hyperleger Fabric Node Private Keys with Intel SGX - Mengzhe Yang, Alibaba \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBlockchain is a technology that uses a lot of cryptography. How to protect the security of core keys is a challenge that this technology always faces. Hyperledger Fabric supports using HSM to protect node keys, but this heterogeneous hardware has the problems of high cost and difficulty in deployment. We have explored a key protection scheme based on Intel SGX technology. We believe that this hardware security solution, which will be built into all Intel CPUs, is ideal for protecting node private keys in consortium blockchain and is also worth applying and promoting through open source technologies. The speech is mainly divided into three parts:  1. Introduce modifications of golang encryption library.  2. Introduce how to bridge the Fabric blockchain and Enclave by implementing Fabric's plugin bccsp module.  3. Introduce why we choose plugin bccsp in BaaS scenario. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrvd"
