Have you had to test work-in-progress features in a production environment? Have you had to struggle with countless merge conflicts due to long running feature branches?\n\nIf any of these problems sound familiar, I have just the thing for you. Say hello to the power of Trunk Based Development, Continuous Deployments and Feature Toggles.\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
