title: 'YOW! Data 2019 - Simon Kaplan - Lessons from Building a Data Platform for Smart Cities'
recordingDate: 1562274001
description: "We've built a data platform for smart cities. This has been deployed in over a dozen cities, and we've learned a lot in the process, about:\n\nwhy data ingestion from IoT networks can range from trivial to very painful, and how to cope;\nhow to architect the system to easily handle many different 'data domains';\ngetting the architecture to work well including making additions of new data sources as simple as we can;\napproaches to analytics and visualisations that have been useful;\nwhy end-user analytics and visualisations are critical;\nhow user permissions for smart city applications can be different to more 'normal' applications.\nand lots more\nIn the talk, I'll walk through the lessons learned and show off examples of the system in action.\n\nThe goal is to use the platform as an exemplar of the design principles, this is not a sales pitch for the tool itself.\n\nSimon is CEO of [ui!] the urban institute, APAC.  [ui!] delivers consulting and platforms for smart city applications.  Prior to this he was Director of NICTA Queensland, Executive Dean of Science and Technology at Queensland University of Technology, Head of the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at The University of Queensland, and principal scientist of the CRC for Distributed Systems Technology.  Simon's research has ranged from understanding how technologies and organisations co-evolve to building collaborative work and distributed systems technology platforms.\n\nFor more on YOW!
