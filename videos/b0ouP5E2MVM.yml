recordingDate: 1560815873
description: "Abstract:\nThis session presents an advance look at ADBA, a proposed standard for asynchronous and reactive RDBMS access. This new API is non-blocking, based on java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage and java.utilconcurrent.Flow. This API is not intended to be an extension to or replacement for JDBC. It is an entirely separate API that provides a completely non-blocking RDBMS access and supports reactive streams with back-pressure where appropriate. This session will give an update on the JSR, the API, the reference implementation (RI) and the TCK."
