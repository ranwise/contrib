description: "Istio Performance and Best Practices in Large Scale Kubernetes Cluster - Guang Ya Liu & Chun Lin Yang, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAs many industry cloud solutions and frameworks are adopting Istio since its GA in 2018, it is important to understand its performance in large scale Kubernetes cluster (2000+ nodes). In this session, we will share our test results and observation for Istio 1.1 a 2000 nodes Kubernetes cluster based on the requirement of a large bank in China and also discuss the best practices and tuning guidelines for effectively using Istio service mesh to obtain best performance and scalability. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nror"
