description: "CNCF Serverless WG: Where Do We Go From Here? - Doug Davis, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCome explore the history, goals, outputs and future direction of the CNCF Serverless WG. With the CloudEvents specification nearing its completion, the question of what (if anything) should come next has started to come up. One of the top pain-points mentioned for people using Serverless is the lack of interop and portability of their functions - does this open the door for a second sandbox project? Is it too soon? In this session we'll discuss, with the audience, these options and gather feedback to help influence what the WG does next. Come prepared with your thoughts and ideas! \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrqS"
