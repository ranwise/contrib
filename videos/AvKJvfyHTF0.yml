description: "Let's Play Mini-card-sized Computer Boards on the Business! - Masafumi Ohta, Japanese Raspberry Pi Users Group \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThere are ton of small, mini, card-sized computer boards has been released since Raspberry Pi was born to the production.Lately it is getting increased to apply them to Enterprise business replacing 'old expensive embedded boards' But are they really robust and bearable in production use?   In this session, Masafumi will talk deep-dive topics for business use:  1.Model concepts: why are they cheap?  2.Disk media: are they bearable for the business? (ex.SD)  3.Robustness: it is really robust ( circuits and etc..)?  4.kernel: is it really fit on the boards?  5.Operating System: is it easy to handle?  6.other tips: USB, SoC thermo, Auto-deploy, Edge-AI and etc..  And Masafumi discuss a couple of use cases at Enterprise companies to look into deeply and learn some practices.  1.opportunities to use the boards  2.how to use the boards  3.how to manage the boards ( especially to overcome drawbacks ) \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrur"
