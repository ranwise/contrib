description: "IngressRoute: A Path Towards a Better Ingress Object for Kubernetes - David Cheney, VMware \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe limitations of the Kubernetes Ingress object have been papered over with annotations by the community for several years. Contour, the Ingress controller my team are building, introduced a new CRD which addresses the limitations of the incumbent Ingress object and unlocks the ability for teams and operators to utilise modern web application deployment practices in multi team and multi tenant Kubernetes clusters.    In this talk Iâ€™ll explain, from the point of view of an Ingress controller implementor, the limitations of the ingress object, and how our IngressRoute CRD addresses the current shortcomings while making it possible for multiple teams to collaborate and delegate responsibility in multi tenant scenarios.    A slide deck from an earlier version of this talk is available here: https://dave.cheney.net/paste/ingress-is-dead-long-live-ingressroute.pdf \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrn1"
