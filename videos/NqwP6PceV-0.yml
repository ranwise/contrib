description: "Serverless: Building a WeChat Mini-Program with 100 Million Users in 7 days - Tinafang & Masonlu, Tencent \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWeChat provides a ubiquitous mobile application platform with a reach of over 900MM MAUs & 1MM registered devs building everything from e-commerce to games to banking apps.    We will describe how a customer with 1 engineer built and deployed a top 30 WeChat Mini-Program in 7 days using the Tencent Cloud Serverless Platform -- and has now achieved over 100MM registered customers, with 12MM MAUs.    We'll walk through the technical details(container orchestration, function cold start, and application performance & monitoring) of how the platform enables customers to build reliable, performant, and safe apps without having to manage infrastructure or operations -- all while scaling apps to 100MM users without managing servers, infrastructure, or operations. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrpX"
