recordingDate: 1562646634
description: "Apache Beam: Portability in the times of Real Time Streaming\n\nApache Beam was open sourced by the big data team at Google in 2016, and has become an active community with participants from all over. Beam is a framework to define data processing workflows and run them on various runners (Flink included). In this talk, I will talk about some cool things you can do with Beam + Flink such as running pipelines written in Go and Python; then I’ll mention some cool tools in the Beam ecosystem. Finally, we’ll wrap up with some cool things we expect to be able to do soon - and how you can get involved.\n\nFlink Forward San Francisco 2019\n#flinkforward"
