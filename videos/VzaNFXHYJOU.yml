description: "Keynote: CRDs, No Longer 2nd Class Thing! - Jing Xu, Software Engineer, Google & Xing Yang, Lead Architect, OpenSDS \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)  \n\nCustom Resource Definition (CRD) is a powerful way of extending Kubernetes APIs. In the past, CRD has been mainly used for out-of-tree, third-party things. Today, with the constant improvement of CRD, there is an ongoing effort to refine and enhance Kubernetes as an modular and extensible platform by factoring everything but the bare essentials out of “core” Kubernetes. CRDs and their controllers start to be used for managing even in-tree, first-party Kubernetes resources.    In this session, We will take you on a journey of building CRDs as first class citizens in Kubernetes based on our first-hand experience. This made us believe that CRDs can be used for core resources and integrated seamlessly with other core API objects. We will also introduce Kubebuilder, a SDK to build and publish Kubernetes APIs, and explain how Kubebuilder makes it easy to write a custom controller for CRD. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrqD"
