language: English
recordingDate: 1562575573
description: 'Variable fonts are a transformative evolution of type design that has huge performance and design implications for the web. When coupled with CSS custom properties and calculations, they make for a completely new way to think about typography and UX. This talk will show how these technologies and techniques can be combined in a unique way to enable dynamic, fluidly scaling typography that reacts to screen size and other aspects of user context. Itâ€™s a perfect complement for better design systems and accessibility, too.'
