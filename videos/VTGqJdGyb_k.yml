description: ".NET Summit 2019, Minsk\nFreaky .NET Track\nGeneral Partner - ArasCorp Development Center (https://companies.dev.by/arascorp-development-center) \n\nFull Stack Web in F#, Tomasz Heimowski\nDuring this talk you'll learn what SAFE Stack stands for. You'll see how to create web applications in F# on both client and server side. Following a simple Model-View-Update pattern that was inspired by Elm language you'll discover that it's fairly easy to create rich clients. On the server side we'll build the solution on top ASP.NET Core. \nStarting with some theory, we'll move to a practical example with live coding to develop the app from scratch."
