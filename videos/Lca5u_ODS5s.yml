description: "Intro: Open Policy Agent - Torin Sandall, Styra \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a general-purpose policy engine that enables fine-grained, context-aware policy enforcement across the stack. OPA is used in production by companies like Netflix, Intuit, and Chef for a variety of use cases like microservice authorization, Kubernetes admission control, and end-user API authorization. This session provides an introduction to the OPA project. You will learn how OPA works and how it can be applied to a range of technology. Come to this talk if you are responsible for securing Kubernetes within your organization, building an internal security platform for custom microservices, or just interested in policy and security. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrrB"
