description: "The domain of Payments, Finance, and more generally FinTech, is a fast-growing industry that reached record global investment of $111.8B in 2018. The underlying technology that powers this incredible growth is also evolving rapidly. Hosted by Uber, MoneyCon 2019 brought together engineers from leading tech companies to present on the latest topics in payments engineering.\n\n\nIn this talk during MoneyCon 2019, Dropbox's Kirill Sapchuk and Evgeny Skarbovsky discuss how revenue optimization (fighting involuntary churn) has evolved at Dropbox over the last few years from some simpler ideas and experiments around retries up to an ML-based approach that they are working on today."
