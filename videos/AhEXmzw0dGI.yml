title: 'Integrate Flink with Hive Ecosystem - Xuefu Zhang & Bowen Li'
recordingDate: 1562631867
description: "Integrate Flink with Hive Ecosystem\n\nAlong with the community's effort, at Alibaba we have explored Flink's potential as an execution engine not just for stream processing but also for batch processing. The findings are encouraging, so we have initiated our effort to make Flink's batching capabilities full-fledged, especially in SQL support. While comparing Flink to a mature SQL tool, we identified a major gap: a well integration with Hive ecosystem. This is crucial to the success of Flink SQL and batch processing because the majority Flink and other big data users have already established a data ecosystem around Hive. Therefore, we have decided to promote a close integration of Flink with Hive ecosystem.\n\nIn this talk we will present functional and design proposals as well as a roadmap to the ultimate goal. We will also share the latest development in this direction and the early feedback and outcomes.\n\nFlink Forward San Francisco 2019\n#flinkforward"
