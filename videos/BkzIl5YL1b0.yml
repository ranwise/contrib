The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nMost of the available software and tools to manage kubernetes clusters assume an internet connection. In practice, this requirement is not always possible and let end users alone to get started with Kubernetes.  The session will share different strategies to easily install, upgrade and manage Kubernetes in an offline environment.  Rong Zhang will talk about his experience in the bare metal environment and how they are using Kubespray and Harbor to manage their offline infrastructure. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NroT"
