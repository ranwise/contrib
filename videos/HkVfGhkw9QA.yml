Data or workflow problems are solved on the Rails console.\n\nBut, two years in, your app has grown. Identifying, researching, and fixing those data and workflow problems takes more of your time and attention. It frustrates your business stakeholders, your customers and, of course, you.\n\nThis talk will look at a Rails-based web store–including inventory, payment processing, fraud mitigation and customer notifications–and explore how we can build tools into our apps to discover when things go sideways and then help get things back on track."
