description: "New Cgroup Subsystem for Buffer Write io and Network RX Control in Kernel - Dongdong Chen, Tencent \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nResources on linux machine could be controlled by cgroup subsystem, such as memory and cpu. While we cannot control buffer write io and network rx before kernel 4.x. For this, we add two new cgroup subsystems in kernel, to control buffer write io and network rx, which allow user to assign different resource values to different jobs for QOS. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NruK"
