recordingDate: 1560803267
description: "During this April 2019 meetup in San Francisco, Uber product manager, Atul Gupte, introduces Data Science Workbench, our in-house data analytics solution. \n\nEvery aspect of the Uber experience, including in-app ETAs, menu recommendations, map labeling, driver dispatch, and customer support, is powered by data and machine learning. In this talk, we explore our strategy of building data science tools by working with our most advanced users to democratize complex techniques for less-technical users."
