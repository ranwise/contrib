description: "The techniques and patterns used in functional programming are very different from object-oriented programming, and when you are just starting out it can be hard to know how they all fit together.\n\nIn this big picture talk for FP beginners, I'll present some of the common tools that can be found in a functional programmer's toolbelt; tools such as \"map\", \"apply\", \"bind\", and \"sequence\". What are they? Why are they important? How are they used in practice? And how do they relate to scary sounding concepts like functors, monads, and applicatives?\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
