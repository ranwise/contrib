description: "Abstract:\nIn this talk, we will look into reasons why you should take into account GraphQL for your next project, but also how you can benefit from it if you add it to your existing project. All of this will be done through code of course, since code is worth more than words.\n\nAfter this deep dive, you will know precisely what is GraphQL and what it isn't when you should use it and how to do it in real life projects.\n\nCome seeking knowledge, and you will leave this talk with new tricks in your bag and excellent understanding of GraphQL."
