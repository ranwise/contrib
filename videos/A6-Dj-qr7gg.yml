description: "Keynote: Tencent: Kubernetes in the Billions – Yunong Xiao, Director of Engineering, Principal Architect, Tencent Cloud \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAt Tencent, our business touches everything from gaming, social media, payments, to cloud computing. We’d like to share our story of how K8s is broadly used at Tencent, taking care of our infrastructure and platform needs while freeing us to focus on our strategic and business imperatives.  We’ll go over a few use cases and their architecture on K8s: 1) The Tencent GPU computing platform uses K8s to manage our large GPU fleet, allowing us to unify resource scheduling and improve cluster utilization 2) The WeChat payments platform utilizing K8s to enable customers to send over 1 billion daily transactions 3) Building the Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE), which provides container-centric, highly scalable and high-performance container management services.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/NuHc"
