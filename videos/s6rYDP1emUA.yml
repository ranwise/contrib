recordingDate: 1561707821
description: "Which NuGet package was that type in again? In this session, let's build a \"reverse package search\" that helps finding the correct NuGet package based on a public type.\n\nTogether, we will create a highly-scalable serverless search engine using Azure Functions and Azure Search that performs 3 tasks: listening for new packages on NuGet.org (using a custom binding), indexing packages in a distributed way, and exposing an API that accepts queries and gives our clients the best result. Expect lots of live coding!\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
