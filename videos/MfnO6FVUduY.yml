description: "Speaker: Andrew Gregovic (PayPal)\n\nAndrew is currently a software development manager at PayPal Singapore, working in the Consumer Financial Services team.\n\nMost of his technical experience is centred around product development, as well as data/database problems in the context of building scalable, robust and high-performance applications. He loves dabbling in machine learning. By accident rather than intent, he has a colourful workplace background, everything from being a co-founder of a New Zealand loyalty/virtual payments startup to working in large multi-nationals. After moving around a lot around Asia Pacific, he is finding Singapore to be his favourite place and I hope he’ll move less in the future. Obviously because of the best chicken rice in the world.\n\nSo, engineer, you think you can be a product manager?\n\nI think I can smell your angst – you are bored following other people’s requirements and want to build your own products? After all, how hard can it be?\n\nI will share the key differences between the Engineering & Product mindsets. You’ll learn that it’s not for the fainthearted or feeble brained, that it requires application of The Force and other Jedi tricks. You’ll also hear some other advice for the aspiring Padawans coming from the Engineering background. But beware – once you cross to the Dark Side it’s near impossible to come back!\n\nEvent Site: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
