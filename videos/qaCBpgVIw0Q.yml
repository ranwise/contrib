description: "!!Con 2019 - Let’s expand the meaning of “GAME FEEL”!! It ain’t just the crunchy boomy bits! by Ayla Myers\n\nWe’ve all played games that don’t feel quite right. Sometimes they seem too floaty, sometimes that OOMPH factor is missing, and sometimes we get hit even when we’re sure we pressed that dodge button in time. “Game feel” refers to how well a game’s visuals, audio, design, and mechanics line up with how our brains think they ~should~ feel. But oftentimes, the conversation on “good game feel” ends up boiling down to crunchy sounds, tight controls, and excessive screen shake.\n\nBut in this talk we’ll be going even further–let’s explore the unknown reaches of game feel together! You think zero-latency inputs feel tight? How about ~negative~ latency? Let’s talk about all the weird things we can do in the name of improving game feel, even to the point of breaking our games if it means matching our brains’ silly expectations about how they should work."
