description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nThere’s a lot of talk nowadays about the impact that artificial intelligence (AI) will have on testing. There’s a new generation of testing tools being developed that employ AI with promises of making testing much more efficient for us.\n\nThis is very exciting, and I look forward to using these tools. However, the tester in me also realizes that testing tools aren’t the only products utilizing AI. Aspects of AI such as machine learning exist today in products that we’re using on a daily basis!\n\nI reject the common notion that AI is this omniscient black box that doesn’t require testing, and I’ll spend 2019 touring the world to spread this message.\n\nAbout Angie Jones\nAngie Jones is a Senior Developer Advocate at Applitools who has developed automation strategies and frameworks for countless software products. As a Master Inventor, she is known for her innovative and out-of-the-box thinking style which has resulted in more than 25 patented inventions in the US and China.
