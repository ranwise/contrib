recordingDate: 1562786003
description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nMicrosoft Cloud App Security provides organizations with enterprise grade protection to cloud applications. One of the main capabilities of CAS is the real time detection of threats like compromised accounts, insider threat and ransomware, based on abnormal user activity.\nIn this talk we will describe our search for a right stateful streaming platform to empower our detections engine, the reasons that led us to choose Flink, and the architecture we built on top of Flink. We will share details about the challenges of constructing a complex job with multiple levels of statistical analysis, custom windowing, and inline machine learning model updating. We will also share our experience running Flink in Azure and connecting it to our production eco-system.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
