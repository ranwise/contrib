Colin explains the basics like the conventional wisdom of choosing file formats, how to fine tune image quality, and serving responsive images. Rick and Colin also discuss some of the more advanced topics like the roles of human biology, automation, and security.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEyvFpz5A6Q"
