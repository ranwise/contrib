description: "Multi-Cloud Machine Learning Data and Workflow with Kubernetes - Lei Xue, Momenta & Fei Xue, Google  \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAutonomous vehicles require hardware accelerated machine learning for critical problems such as tracking and classification. Momenta trains ML models in on-prem regions and public clouds, each comes with different GPUs and network interfaces (Infiniband, RoCE).     In this talk we discuss how we use Kubernetes to build a multi-cloud ML platform - in particular how we manage training data across different environments; how we address multi-user and gang scheduling; and how we support heterogeneous hardware. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrnh"
