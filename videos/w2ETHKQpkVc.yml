language: English
recordingDate: 1561623468
description: 'In a cloud native world enamored of Microservices and Serverless, meet Quarkus—Java’s brilliant response to technologies like Node.js, Python and Go that had until recently proven quicker, smaller and arguably more nimble. But we know seeing is believing—we’ll show you Quarkus in action. Get ready to experience “Supersonic, Subatomic Java”— and make Open Source frameworks like Hibernate and Apache Camel faster, smaller and more dynamically scalable than ever before.'
