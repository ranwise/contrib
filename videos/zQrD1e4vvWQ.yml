description: "Speaker: Ujjwal Sharma\r\n\r\nCryptography is all around us, and that’s a good thing. In a world that increasingly depends on data, leveraging cryptography is mandatory for any modern application that deals with private user data.\r\n\r\nAs a Node.js core team member, I will focus on the current state of cryptography in Node.js regarding security, interoperability and performance: What has happened, what is about to happen? What are our long-term plans?\r\n\r\nNode.js is made for the web and already well-equipped for the challenges of cryptography in today’s applications! You will come away with a deeper understanding of some of these challenges and how to solve them using the Node.js crypto module (and how not to!).\r\n\r\nPresenter's bio\r\n\r\nUjjwal is a Node.js core collaborator, Electron maintainer, Google Summer of Code mentor and ex-student. An international speaker and a JavaScript/C++ developer, he has been working with the V8 team and the TC39 committee to help make JavaScript better, one commit at a time. He loves to talk about open source software, DevOps, JavaScript, Web Standards and the Open Web.\r\n\r\nEvent Page:\r\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/261294292/\r\nhttps://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/259235995/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Huiren Woo\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/pW0o/"
