description: "Evolving Deep Learning Platform with Knative - Ti Zhou, Baidu \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe emergence of Knative has enhanced the capabilities of Baidu internal deep learning platform. The workflow between training and inference services can be implemented based on Knative eventing. The training and inference services can also implement smart routing and auto-scaling by leveraging Knative serving. And the training job image can also be built by Knative build framework. After using Knative, Baidu internal deep learning platform has reduced resource consumption by 20%.    In this speech, we will show how to use the capabilities of Knative to reconstruct deep learning platform, including:  Expanding eventing to achieve training to inference pipeline automation  Use serving to implement smart routing and auto-scaling of inference services  Use build to automate the process of generating the training images \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrpU"
