description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nSo you're on the hook for millions of transactions per minute. You've already considered all the buzzwords? Blockchain? Machine learning? Microserverless? You're out of buzzwords? Desperate for something that just works? Bonus points for looking indie on Hacker News? Try Apache Flink! In all seriousness, this is a dive into how our team approached confronting a wholly new, millions-of-events-per-minute stream processing challenge, and how we used Flink to solve it. None of started as experts, and we will outline how Flink was an ideal candidate to solve our problems relatively quickly as we all learned it together. Further, weâ€™ll also discuss our process, including creating efficient proofs of concept, in order to select which stream processing framework to use, and how Flink fit into our architecture. We will also cover how to use Flink to reduce customer toil in situations like ours. We cover why and how it solves most of our hard problems for us, as well as current points of friction. Ultimately, what can Flink do for you?\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
