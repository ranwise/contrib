The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBluetooth Low Energy is being used extensively in almost all the modern \"Smart\" devices from smart phones, smart devices, smart watches as well as advanced medical equipment. This talk will introduce several new Bluetooth Low energy hacking techniques, various tools and techniques for performing attacks on Bluetooth Low Energy Device.    The talk will focus on gathering enough information about BLE devices from the security standpoint, discovering them, reverse engineering the mobile application(if any) and attacking them.    As a part of live demonstration we will be using some \"Smart\" BLE Fitness Trackers, reverse engineer their mobile applications and gather enough information to attack them. We will also see how uploading the malicious firmware over the air is also possible. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nruu"
