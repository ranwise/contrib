description: "!!Con 2019 - Musician experiments: I fed a bot my songs and asked it to write more! Plus: A concert! by Dawn Xiana Moon\n\nWhat happens when you ask a bot to be your co-writer?\n\nFor over 15 years, I’ve been a singer-songwriter that’s performed throughout the Midwest and East Coast. One night, I found a cute little virtual robot hanging out on the internet that wanted to become a songwriter too! But the poor thing had only generated random text before. So I fed the bot 80 of my original songs and asked it to write lyrics based on that material.\n\nThen I took its lyrics and set them to music. Robot co-writing! I’ll talk about this process and give you a mini-concert featuring my favorite bot’s writing – and together we’ll look for meaning in the little bot’s music!"
