description: "Java Developer’s Journey in Kubernetes - Arun Gupta, Amazon Web Services \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nDeploying your Java application in a Kubernetes cluster could feel like Alice in Wonderland. You keep going down the rabbit hole and don’t know how to make that ride comfortable. This no-slide and code-only session will explain how a Java application can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, it will explain the following:    Package the application as Docker image  Create Kubernetes manifests  Create Helm charts  Test in a local k8s cluster  Debug pods using Java IDE  Observability using Istio  Canary and A/B testing  Migrate application from dev to prod environments  Deployment pipeline on desktop and in the cloud \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrlQ"
