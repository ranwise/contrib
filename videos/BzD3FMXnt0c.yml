One of them is an insightful future outlook and being ready for what's yet to come.\n\nWorking on a new project, or joining a startup - there's an expectation for your team to grow. Growth is good. The more hands on board, the more you can achieve. But it's not all roses.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at challenges and risks related to the fast growth of an engineering and cross-functional team. How to notice first signs of the change? When to react? How to keep your team's culture when growing? What will have to change, what can stay the same?\n\nSummarizing past experiences - from bootstrapping a remote team from zero to 20 people, as well as growing DeepMind Health engineering team from 20 to 80 in a bit over a year - there are patterns emerging that can help other teams avoid pitfalls that come naturally with a rapid growth.\n\nAt the end of this talk you should be aware of what changes to expect as your team grows, how to notice critical inflection points, and react to them so your team comes out bigger and stronger.\n\nAbout Joanna Chwastowska\nJoanna Chwastowska graduated in Computer Science from the Academy of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland. She's then joined newly open Google Krakow office, and worked as Software Engineer, growing from an individual contributor to Tech Lead Manager across the following 8 years. On her next adventure she's been an Engineering Site Lead for a fashion startup from New York (shopspring.com). Finally, last year she's moved to London to work as an Engineering Lead for Google's DeepMind Health team.\n\nEngineer at heart, manager by choice â€“ she loves to explore human nature and to work with engineers to unfold their full potential. By doing so she hopes to help others (and herself;) to grow, and have greater, positive impact on the world."
