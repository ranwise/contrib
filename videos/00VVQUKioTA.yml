description: "In his keynote, Peter Garzarella, Head of Volkswagen Group IT Software Development, will be talking about Volkswagen’s journey in software development. He will take a deep dive into the topics Controlling Complexity and Coding Society. You will learn more about the history of Software Development at Volkswagen, modern software solutions in factories and future plants. And of course – Volkswagen’s worldwide Software Development Centers, with its working methods and current projects. In the second half of the keynote, Peter Garzarella and Nils Heuer, Global Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services, will talk about the cooperation between Volkswagen and Amazon Web Services. As these seemingly different companies embark on their joint journey to develop the Industrial Cloud, new challenges arise around engineering and management. In an initiative with the goal to standardize, deeply integrate and combine the IT at the production level of machinery, equipment, and systems across all 122 production plants of the Volkswagen Group, traditional IT development approaches reach their limits. How do both companies work together successfully and align their work styles to tackle these challenges?\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
