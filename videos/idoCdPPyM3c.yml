description: "!!Con 2019 - Paper Synthesizer! Music created with Augmented Reality by Jes Wolfe!\n\nThis will be a combination talk and short musical performance. I’ll demonstrate a small Dynamic Medium / Augmented Reality rig - using projection mapping to bring the digital world onto a surface of a table (rather than using glasses or a screen) and a webcam to read handwritten data on pieces of paper back into the computer. I’ll explain how all this works and then use this system as the UI to create and perform an original piece of music."
