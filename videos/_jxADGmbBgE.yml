description: "The domain of Payments, Finance, and more generally FinTech, is a fast-growing industry that reached record global investment of $111.8B in 2018. The underlying technology that powers this incredible growth is also evolving rapidly. Hosted by Uber, MoneyCon 2019 brought together engineers from leading tech companies to present on the latest topics in payments engineering.\n\nAirbnb Payments has a distributed, service-oriented system for order management and payment processing, and consistency is a challenge in distributed systems. In this talk during MoneyCon 2019, Airbnb's Sophie Behr and John Chew discuss their company's transition to that service-oriented architecture and how they leveraged idempotency to make their systems robust and (eventually) consistent."
