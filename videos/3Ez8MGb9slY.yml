description: "Release Engineering as a Service - The Art of Integrating with K8s - Maryam Labib & Ramya Shenoy, Pivotal \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWe're missing opportunities to improve and optimize the software integration process. This lack of focus can decrease code quality, mask incompatibility between components, and frustrate users that seek reliable release cadence.    In this talk, two creative engineers will tell the story of how their team built ‘Release Engineering as a Service’ in order to tackle slow release cycles and endless bug reports.    The aim of the talk is to help open source contributors understand how small changes to their integration process can have an enormous impact on how fast their favorite features get delivered.     Maryam and Ramya will discuss:  - What is a release engineering team in the context of Kubernetes?   - How should we use CI/CD to integrate software consistently?  - How can we improve feedback cycles using automation, parallelization, and reutilization? \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrmU"
