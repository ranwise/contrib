description: "For years, we’ve been talking about home automation and IoT. There are universal remotes, wall panels and apps to control devices in your home. But Works with Nest is more than just an on/off switch. It’s about making your house a more thoughtful home. And, as a result, making your home safer, more energy efficient, and more aware. In this talk with Andrew Urman, you'll learn more about the Works with Nest developer program and join us in making this vision become reality.\n\nWatch more talks from Ubiquity Dev Summit here: https://goo.gl/FS9v3U\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\nMusic by Terra Monk: http://www.terramonk.com"
