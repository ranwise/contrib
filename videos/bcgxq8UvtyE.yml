The serverless programming model offers an alternative to traditional job systems that can reduce overhead while increasing productivity and happiness. We'll look at some typical background processing scenarios and see how to modify them to run as serverless functions. You'll see the advantages and trade-offs, as well as some situations in which you might not want to go serverless. We'll also talk about the serverless ecosystem, and you'll walk away with the knowledge and tools you need to experiment on your own."
