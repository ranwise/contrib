description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/JeroenSterken1/migrating-a-modern-spring-web-application-to-serverless-146724760\n\nIn this presentation we want to share how we transformed a typical spring realtime web application called “Pigslot” into a serverless application. This application is about … (you guessed it) : pigs, allowing our customer to offer timeslots to farmers so they can make a reservation to deliver their pigs to the slaughterhouse.\n\nA talk that might be avoided by vegetarians although the use case was all about animal welfare! So come join us if you want to know all about a pig’s journey to serverless and the challenges we encountered to make this a serverless application for easy scaling and resource optimization. We will share our experiences and give you tips and tricks on what we learned in the process, like:\n\n- Spring resource optimization\n- Server side rendering versus fat clients\n- Session management\n- Realtime UI updates in serverless environments\n- Connecting functions\n- Security\n- Portability between cloud providers\n- …"
