title: 'Christopher Werner: Prediction of Status Changes in Software Tests | PyData Hamburg Spring Edition'
language: English
recordingDate: 1561753720
description: "Automated software tests are not to be missed in todays software development processes. Usually there are plenty of testcases to be run on a cyclic basis to ensure functionality. New implementations are risking earlier working states and thus need to be tested. Executing all testcases needs a lot of computation power and can take up to weeks. So, if the results of testcases could be predicted based on earlier outcomes, time and energy could be reduced dramatically....\n\nMore on Christopher and his talk: https://bit.ly/2Dtyky3\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
