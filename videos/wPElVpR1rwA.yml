description: "Build A Weather App With Vanilla Javascript Tutorial | Javascript For Beginners\n\n‚ù§Become a patreon for exclusive videos and more!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/dev_ed\n\n\nToday I wanted to focus more on building an actual project using vanilla javascript. This video is intended for those who are looking on creating their first projects using javascript or you might be here from freecodecamp with their javascript weather app project.\n\nWe are going to be using darksky api to pull all the necessary weather information you need. Darksky can be used free for up to 1000 api calls, so it is great for a demo project. \n\nThis project is great if you want to extend your knowledge with vanilla javascript by building a real world weather app.\n\nüìî Materials used in this video:\n\nDarksky API : https://darksky.net\nIcons : https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/\n\nüõ¥ Follow me on:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/deved94\nGithub: https://github.com/DevEdwin"
