description: "A micro-service architecture is a great strategy for decomposing a monolith. In this talk, I’ll show you some of the pros and cons of micro-services and how you can leverage OWIN, .NET, Event Sourcing and the Onion Architecture to gradually move your monolith into a bright new future.\n\nIf I have to name a single hype in software architecture land then I would have to mention the micro-service architecture. Micro-services are supposed to be small, have a very focused purpose, can be deployed independently, are completely self-supporting and loosely coupled. Ideally, micro-services are technology agnostic, but hey, we’re in the .NET space, aren’t we? And they are not a goal, but a means to an end. In fact, a micro-service architecture has many benefits and are a great strategy for decomposing a monolith. So how do you build a micro-service? What technologies does the .NET realm offer for us? And what if you don’t want to deploy them independently? In this talk, I’ll show you some of the pros and cons of micro-services and how you can leverage OWIN, .NET, Event Sourcing and the Onion Architecture to gradually move your monolith into a bright new future."
