description: 'Cloud Foundry BOSH Part 1: Vadim Spivak (@vadimspivak), of the Cloud Foundry development team, presented Cloud Foundry BOSH at the OpenStack Design Summit on April 18, 2012, in San Francisco. His presentation is divided into three parts. BOSH is an open source toolchain for release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of large-scale distributed services. In this presentation, Vadim discusses the motivations for building BOSH and the goals for the project, as well as outlining its role in deploying and managing CloudFoundry.com. He then quickly delved into the details, outlining some of the artifacts used in BOSH as well as detailing the architecture of a full-scale BOSH deployment.'
