description: "Speaker: Yeo Kheng Meng, IoT Engineer, SP Group\n\nSpeaking at tech meetups and conferences may seem daunting. More so if you are a young engineer with limited industry experience. What can you talk about? Will others find it interesting? I'll share about my projects and speaking experiences at dozens of tech meetups and conferences.\n\nKheng Meng is an IoT Engineer at SP Digital where he develops sensors and IoT gateways. Outside of work, he volunteers at Repair Kopitiam where he teaches people repair skills to reduce the buy-and-throw-away culture. He also has an awesomely useless interest in retrocomputing.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/254063930/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by:\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lR1i/"
