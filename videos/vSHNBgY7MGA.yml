description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\nMost of the demos on reactive programming I’ve seen use either simple one-liner examples, or complicated codebases that can leave the viewer behind. I’d like to strike a balance, using an example real enough to impart understanding, but simple enough to inspire a room full of heads nodding along!\n\nMaybe you’ve heard about this new reactive thing and want to give it a try. Or perhaps management have heard about this new reactive thing, and told you to give it a try. Either way this session will give you an introduction to reactive programming, using Spring’s support for reactive streams to convert a simple but realistic Java application from imperative to reactive. We’ll cover everything from the building blocks of reactor through to a running reactive application, sharing some hard-won wisdom along the way."
