description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nIt’s all well and good for the agile manifesto to recommend self-organising teams, but what does that actually mean in practice? What’s the best way to do it, how far should you take it? Total anarchy is probably not the answer here… right?\n\nAfter bouncing around leading a whole bunch of teams of different shapes and sizes over my career, I have some insights into how to guide effective self-organisation and create amazing teams. I’ll also share plenty of battle stories, including major re-organisations of entire engineering departments, structured completely by the developers in them.\n\nWhether your entire department needs shuffling, you’re starting a new team, or just adding a new team member, you should walk away with plenty of ideas of how to guide your team to make the best possible decisions - for themselves.\n\nAbout Rebecca Hill\nRebecca Hill is a software engineer, team lead and international speaker, currently attempting to herd cats (aka developers) and wrangle JavaScript at WeTransfer. Originally from Auckland, New Zealand, she is now based in Amsterdam, which makes it much easier to travel to conferences around the world to share her love for software development - teaching and learning with all the amazing people in this community."
