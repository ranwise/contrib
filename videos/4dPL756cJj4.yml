description: "Intro: Envoy - Lizan Zhou, Tetrate \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nEnvoy is a new cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy which aims to make the network transparent to applications. Envoyâ€™s out of process architecture allows it to be used alongside any language or runtime. At its core, Envoy is an L4 proxy with a pluggable filter chain model. On top of the L4 proxy it also includes a full HTTP stack with a parallel pluggable L7 filter chain. Envoy also has best in class observability using both statistics and distributed tracing.  In this session Lizan Zhou from Tetrate will present how to configure and deploy Envoy in various environment with its extensions, and demonstrate how it can be used with observability and tracing tools.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrrZ"
