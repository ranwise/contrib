description: "Panel Discussion: Metrics that Matter: How to Forge More Diverse, Inclusive Communities  \n\nWhile it is well-recognized that diversity and inclusion are key to healthy open source communities, numbers lag and the ability to foster inclusive environments remains challenging. The CHAOSS Project’s Diversity & Inclusion Workgroup is focused on establishing a set of peer-validated, research-informed standards and best practices to measure, and in turn, increase, diversity and inclusion across open source communities. Join us for an interactive session to learn about our work to date and the progress we’ve made in areas such as creating a set of community-curated metrics to track diversity. Hear how projects like Kubernetes handle community recognition, mentorship and inclusive leadership. Just as important, help us shape our work. Let’s work together to make our collective cloud native communities more welcoming, broader, and heterogeneous. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZe"
