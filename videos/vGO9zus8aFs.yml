description: "Deployment and Management in the Age of Cloud Integrated Applications - Neil Peterson, Microsoft \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nWith the advancement in cloud service capabilities such as databases, cognitive services, and messaging queues, application architecture is extending to include not only code but also managed cloud services. In this talk we will examine the unique challenges in deploying and managing cloud integrated applications.     Topics will include:    - How to deploy and manage code and cloud services as a single unit  - Managing connection strings and keys between application and cloud services  - Comparison of emerging application deployment technology such as the Kubernetes Service Catalog, Terraform, and Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB)    The goal of this talk is to not only consider how cloud integrated applications change deployment and management practices, but to also take a hands on look at the emerging technology that facilitates these deployments. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrmg"
