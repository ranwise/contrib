description: "CodeReady Containers; Simplified Deployment and Cluster API for Desktops - Gerard Braad, Red Hat \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nWith the introduction of OpenShift 4.0, a new method of installation targeting cloud providers was introduced. For CodeReady Containers we provide a simplified method to enable this installation for desktop hypervisors, like kvm, xhyve/hyperkit and Hyper-V on respectively Linux, macOS, and Windows. I will talk about the lessons learned with the previous approaches used to enable desktop deployments, like minikube and minishift and how we improve on this and how we enable the Cluster API to target desktop virtualization. Using the Cluster API it will be possible to scale out and add additional nodes to the cluster, and in our case, you will be able to add nodes to desktop hypervisors. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrnV"
