description: "Intro: Auth SIG - Mo Khan, Red Hat & Mike Danese, Google \n\nWe will present a high level overview of the SIG with an emphasis on recent accomplishments. Furthermore we will discuss immediate goals for the next few releases to help prospective individuals understand where they can get involved. This structure of presentation is similar to what we did in KubeCon NA 2018 - we received generally positive feedback from the community members. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPh3"
