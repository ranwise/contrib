Edureka accomplished this at a price far lower than an in-person class, and as far as I know they are the only internet class that has live lectures on this subject. Teacher was very knowledgeable. I learned basic use of Selenium. No problem with me being in US and teacher in India. They have US 800 number.”\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFor more information, Please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll free)."
