description: "Intro: Cloud Provider SIG - Chris Hoge, OpenStack Foundation & Steve Wong, VMware \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSIG Cloud Provider is focused on ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience across providers and acts as a central group for developing the Kubernetes project in a way that ensures all providers share common privileges and responsibilities. New vendors providing support for Kubernetes should feel equally empowered to do so as any of today's existing cloud providers. We will go over historical context, status, and direction of efforts currently underway including the transition of individual provider SIGs to sub-projects and ongoing work in extracting provider code from the main Kubernetes repository.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrrN"
