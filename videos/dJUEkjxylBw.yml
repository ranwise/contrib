description: "Audible free book & trial at: http://www.audible.com/computerphile\nOur thanks to them.\nP vs NP in The Simpsons and Futurama. Featuring author Simon Singh.\nhttp://simonsingh.net\n\nSimon on Numberphile: http://bit.ly/SimonSinghPlay\n\nClarification: NP actually stands for non-deterministic (or nondeterministic) polynomial. Simon did us a favour by speaking off-the-cuff on this topic and it is our fault for not cleaning up things in the edit. However Simon's (excellent) book covers this in more detail (pages 157-159 in hard cover) and, in it, he opts for nondeterministic without the hyphen.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nFilm by Sean Riley and Brady Haran.\n\nSee the full list of Brady's video projects at: http://bit.ly/bradychannels"
