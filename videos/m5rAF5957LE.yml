description: "Speaker: Mike Riethmuller\r\n\r\nCustom Properties are still a relatively new feature of CSS. Let me introduce you to the basics, some of the tricks and then show you how to use custom properties in CSS for maintainable large scale applications. Let's dive into some of the challenges of responsive design, global and local scope and theming. If there's time, let's write some code together and explore some of what you can do with custom properties.\r\n\r\nPresenter's bio\r\nHi everyone I'm Mike. I'm a web developer from Australia.
