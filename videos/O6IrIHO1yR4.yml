description: "Technology is changing constantly, keeping us on our toes with new frameworks, features, tools, and hardware being released and improved.\n\nIt gives us new choices and decisions to make that affect our product portfolio, our company’s success, our colleagues, our customers, and our bottom line. But what happens when we give in to all this change and start chasing after all these shiny objects without any sort of strategy or direction? We’ll take a look at the impacts of shiny object syndrome along side real world examples pulled from my experiences in large companies and startups. You’ll leave with a better understanding of how your decisions impact your tech, your company, and your customers and a set of questions to ask as you make these decisions.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
