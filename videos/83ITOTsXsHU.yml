description: "Writing kubectl Plugins for Everyone: Develop, Package & Distribute - Ahmet Alp Balkan, Google & Maciej Szulik, Red Hat \n\nMany users install extra tools for tasks they can't do with kubectl. Did you know you can write and distribute your own kubectl subcommands? kubectl had notion of plugins since 2016, but after listening to the community feedback, SIG CLI revisited the idea, and new and simpler plugin mechanism is now available in kubectl. The new mechanism allows anyone to write and distribute their own subcommands to kubectl. This opens the door for community contributions to make kubectl better without having to propose a feature to the kubectl core. During this session, Maciej (lead of SIG CLI) and Ahmet (developer of Krew plugin manager) will explain: * how kubectl plugin mechanism works under the covers * how does a good plugin look like, best practices & available libraries * hands-on demo of developing a plugin * how to package plugins for multiple OS/distros and make them discoverable \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPa2"
