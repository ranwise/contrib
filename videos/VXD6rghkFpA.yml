title: 'Lessons learned from Migrating to a Stateful Streaming Framework - Wei-Che (Tony) Wei'
recordingDate: 1562849996
description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nIn modern applications of streaming frameworks, stateful streaming is arguably one of the most important usage cases. Flink, as a well-supported streaming framework for stateful streaming, readily helps developers spend less efforts on system deployment and focus more on the business logic. Nevertheless, upgrading from an existing production system to a new one with stateful streaming can still be a challenging task for any development team. In this talk, we will share our experience in migrating an existing system at Appier (an AI-based startup specialized with B2B solutions) to stateful streaming with Flink. We will first discuss how stateful streaming matches our business logic and its potential benefits. Then, we review the obstacles that we have encountered during migration, and present our solutions to conquer them. We hope that our experience and tips shared in this talk hints future users to prepare themselves towards applying Flink in their production systems more painlessly.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
