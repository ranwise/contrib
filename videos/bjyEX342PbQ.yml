description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2019. http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nBDD has proven its capability to ensure a feature is developed correctly and meets the original idea of the product owner. But how can we ensure that this idea corresponds to the users expectations? How can we make sure that deploying this feature improves the user experience and not degrade it?\n\nLaurent and Vincent explain how application and usage monitoring help to deliver features that matter. The first stage is to define business expectations alongside the Gherkin scenarios during the writing phase. This way, the feature file describes the two goals that the new functionality needs to meet: the behavior described by the Gherkin scenarios and the business metrics.\n\nThey also share how to monitor the impact of the implemented and deployed feature with Application Performance Management and Usage Analytics. The data gathered by APM tools enhance us to check that the deployed code don’t impact negatively the user experience. The Usage Analytics metrics ensure that the business requirements are met and that the feature is valuable for the users.\n\nThis process is strongly rooted in our development cycle. The behaviour of our application is continuously monitored to decide the fate of the features developed.  With a short users’ feedback loop, we do not spend time and money on features that do not meet their needs. Thanks to this quick feedback, developers implement expected features that matter, based on users’ observation.\n\nAll data is gathered alongside the living documentation generated from the Gherkin scenarios. With this always up-to-date documentation, you can share with your stakeholders (regardless of technical skillset), the feature goal and how it benefits the users.\n\nSlides - https://speakerdeck.com/cucumberbdd/dont-restrict-your-living-documentation-to-a-living-documentation-laurent-py-and-vincent-pretre"
