description: "Abstract:\nJava 10 has local variable type inference, but type inference is not really new in Java. Is type inference good or bad? Are there challenges and limitations to using it? When is a good time to use type inference? This presentation includes details of Java 10 type inference but certainly goes beyond them. It steps back and discusses type inference from the programmerâ€™s point of view and works through the benefits and caveats. At the end of the session, you will be able to decide when to use it and when to avoid it."
