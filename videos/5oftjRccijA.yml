description: "!!Con 2019 - Let’s build a live chat! 👍from the 1800s (?!) 🤔using modern web technology!!! 😮 by Kate Beard\n\nLivechat? From the 1800s?!! No, I’m not talking about AOL or MSN (though it does feel that long ago sometimes). I’m talking electrical telegrams and Morse code.\n\nInspired by a scene The Rescuers Down Under and a keenness to learn the web audio API , I built a program that takes written text and turns it into an audio Morse code message. Then once that was built, I took it to the logical next step: building a chatroom where you can send and receive messages in Morse code with all your coolest and extremely online friends.\n\nFollow me on a journey full of discovery, gifs of mice sending telegrams, oscillators, websockets, and more in putting together this weird, almost entirely useless thing. Fluency in Morse code not required (but would be awesome!!!)"
