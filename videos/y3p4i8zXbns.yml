description: "Debugging with eBPF on Arm Platforms - Leo Yan, Linaro \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nThis session will discuss the in-kernel virtual machine to extract information from a running kernel based on eBPF.    Firstly this session will quickly give brief introduction for eBPF working mechanism so that allow developers to gather information for debug and tuning by attaching eBPF programs using kprobes or tracepoints and is reinforced with a roll-your-own example program that illustrates how userspace can exploit these mechanisms.    After that we move from theory to practice by looking at several userspace tools that allow developers to write high level eBPF programs (or run other peoples pre-canned ones) and process the resulting data. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrtw"
