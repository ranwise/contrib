description: "How I Teach my Second Grade Kid what AI is and How this Relates to BI that Impact your Business - Cupid Chan, Index Analytics \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nOne day, my kid asked me: “Dad, what are you doing at work?” That struck me because being an AI and BI practitioner for about 20 years, I have helped clients on a daily basis, but my how do I explain it to my kids? Well, I didn’t tell them because I thought they would not understand even if I tell them. But that is MY problem. As a consultant, it’s my job to explain to my “clients” so that they understand my proposal, right?! So, I decided to “teach” my kids AI, in the language that they can understand. It turns out this is a very good exercise to help me explain this concept to other people including non-technical executives, as well as technical geeks. It also provides a good framework for me to tie this back to a long-standing BI technology and help my client identifying cases to apply AI/BI in their business.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrsC"
