title: 'Azure IoT Edge development with Azure DevOps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1560798005
description: "The Internet of Things is a technology paradigm that involves the use of internet connected devices to publish data often in conjunction with real-time data processing, machine learning, and/or storage services. Development of these systems can be enhanced through application of modern DevOps principles which include tasks like automation, monitoring, and all steps of the software engineering process from development, testing, quality assurance, and release. We will examine these concepts as they relate to IoT Edge Solutions using Azure DevOps, Application Insights, Azure Container Registries, containerized iot edge devices and Azure Kubernetes Service to create an end-to-end pipeline which deploys, smoke tests, and allows for scalable integration testing using replica sets in k8s.\n\nNotes: @5:55, the Azure IoT Edge task has moved to Azure Pipelines in-house tasks. In-house task means you will have the task pre-installed in any Azure DevOps account, you don't need to install the extension from marketplace to use the Azure IoT Edge task.\n\nResources:\nhttps://github.com/toolboc/IoTEdge-DevOps \nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qetza.replacetokens https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsc-iot.iot-edge-build-deploy  https://github.com/toolboc/azure-iot-edge-device-container"
