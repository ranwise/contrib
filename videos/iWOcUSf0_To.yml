description: "Extending Kubernetes Scheduler for Multi-Cluster and Multi-Cloud Workloads - Illya Chekrygin, Upbound \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nKubernetes did a great job implementing a rich and flexible scheduler for Pods. Today we are extending Pod scheduling for Multi-Cluster environments, expanding and optimizing it even further for non-Kubernetes workloads and resources.     At this talk, we will explore options and possibilities when it comes to scheduling Kubernetes Pods across multiple clusters. In addition, we will examine the benefits, pitfalls, and future for extending the Kubernetes scheduler to Multi-Cloud managed resources and workloads beyond traditional Kubernetes Deployments and Stateful Sets. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrnP"
