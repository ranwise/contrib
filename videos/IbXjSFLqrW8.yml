description: "Full title: Integrate your Search Engine with a Voice Assistant\n\nThe User Experience on a mobile phone is different of that of a tablet and still different of that of a computer screen. You have to adapt your graphical interface, the information displayed but also the calls to your services.\n\nWhen the “User Interface” is a “voice”, the User Experience and the services your application provides need to adjust.\n\nIn this presentation we will adapt, step by step, an Enterprise Search Engine to Google Assistant and, more generally, to a Virtual Voice Assistant. The challenge will be to find the one and only meaningful result with a minimum of round trips while taking into account all the constraints of this type of User Interaction (among which also: \"being funny with the answers\")."
