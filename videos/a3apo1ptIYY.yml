recordingDate: 1562585963
description: "Machine Learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, and Deep Learning (neural networks) is growing even faster, with lots of data and computing power at our fingertips. \nThis talk is a practical (very little math) guide to computer vision and deep learning.\n\nWe will look at a deep learning project from start to finish, look at how to program and train a neural network and gradually refine it using some tips and tricks that you can steal for your future deep learning projects.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
