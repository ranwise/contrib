description: "JDK 9 changed how easy it is to move to newer versions of Java. In this session, we’ll look at all the changes that might affect moving an application from JDK 8 or earlier to JDK 11. This will include all the changes that are included from JDK 9 and JDK 10.\n\nThree releases of Java in one year! A big change to how Java is delivered, but it’s not the only one. JDK 9 introduced a significant change in the form of the module system that can impact how easy it is to run existing applications. JDK 9 also started a long overdue cleanup of the JDK, removing features as well as adding them. This has continued in JDK 10 and JDK 11.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at all the areas of JDK 9, 10 and 11 that may impact application migration. This will cover all aspects: Java language syntax, class libraries and JVM options (a significant number of which have changed in these releases).\n\nWe’ll also look at how the new JDK release cadence will impact Java support and the choices of which Java versions to use in production."
