description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nTo quote http://www.apache.org/foundation - “The mission of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is to provide software for the public good. We do this by providing services and support for many like-minded software project communities of individuals who choose to join the ASF.” The ASF provides a home to several hundred OSS projects. Likely, if you are developing software on a daily basis you did run into one of those projects at some point in time. If you have been digging a bit deeper, you may have encountered the phrase “The Apache Way” - often used in relation to how projects at the ASF should work. Depending on who you ask, very likely you will get different answers as to what actual meaning of “The Apache Way” is. This talk tries to give a glimpse behind the scenes - with a strong focus on what the implications of best practices advertised at the ASF are for downstream users of it’s projects. It's all about pulling you in to become active and contribute yourself.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
