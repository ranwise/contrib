description: "Anatomy of the Linux Kernel - Tanish Shinde, Cypher Project \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nThe Linux kernel is the core of a large and complex operating system, and while it's huge, it is well organized in terms of subsystems and layers. In this talk, the viewer explores the general structure of the Linux kernel and gets to know its major subsystems and core interfaces.  When working with Linux, you easily can download any of the most common distributions to install and configureâ€”be it Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE or something entirely different. And although you should give several distributions a spin, building your own custom, minimal Linux distribution is also a beneficial and wonderful learning exercise, also understanding the complex structure is critical, to perform a anatomy of the operating system is as if not more crucial than the construction of the Operating System.  In this talk, we will understand the core inner workings of the Linux Kernel and also construct a minimal operating system to understand those inner workings to contribute to the future development of the Linux Kernel and understand the complexities and interpret them in a simple and easy to understand language.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/NruE"
