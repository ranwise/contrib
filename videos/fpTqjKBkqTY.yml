description: "Speaker: Joeri Schilders (The Magic Sauce)\n\nIn his own words, Hi, my name is Joeri. I have been in Asia half my life and I am an international speaker on innovation, creativity, design thinking and digital transformation. I did not go to the University of Innovation. Instead, I bring real stories, tough lessons, tools and tricks learned from running over 100 innovation projects over the past decade, working with some of the coolest industries and business. I have the battle scars to show. Outside that, I work in the design and innovation team of one of the most innovative banks in the world, with the goal to inspire collaboration and push a conservative industry to look beyond what is currently possible and acceptable so that they can realise their innovation agenda. Rather than just being creative, I am also a creator: I upload weekly YouTube videos to demystify innovation and creativity. My videos are lighthearted, easy to apply and engaging shorts filled with tips, tools, downloads and stories. In other words, if you are looking to inspire, provoke and excite your people around all things innovation, and you want that done in a way that is human, practical, engaging, and creative, let’s have a chat.\n\nI love technology, but I love humans more\n\nWe live in a world growing in technology. Everyone talks about it, entrepreneurs are building it, and business and government are pumping money into it. However, many of the challenges we face every day will not be solved with technology, because they are not technology challenges; they are human challenges. Technology can be the enabler, but the real solution lies in us humans. Particularly in the workplace, we rely on tech to force communication, collaboration, teamwork, etc. but they often become more of a distraction, rather than a solution. Let’s look at some simple ways to bring out more humanity in a tech-mad world.\n\nEvent Page: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
