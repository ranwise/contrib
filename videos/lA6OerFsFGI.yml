description: "Vlad Alexeev, lead engineer at Avito, — on UI testing\n\nThe talk at CodeMobile Conference 2019: http://www.codemobile.co.uk\n\nIn Avito, we've developed a stable, scalable and fast way to run our UI tests. We decided to run tests in parallel using our Mac Mini machines. We haven’t found any off-the-shelf tool for doing that, so we created our own — Emcee. That’s what Vlad told about."
