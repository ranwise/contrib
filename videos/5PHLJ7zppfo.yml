description: "!!Con 2019 - Even more vintage: releasing music on a custom-built Game Boy cartridge! by Peter Sobot\n\nHip musicians are releasing their work on vinyl these days. Some artists even release on cassette tape. Is it possible to be even more hip? The answer is yes: I helped a friend release their album as a playable Nintendo Game Boy game!\n\nIâ€™ll go over the adventures of putting this project together, from designing and building hardware for full-quality audio playback, writing assembly code for multiple platforms, reverse engineering 30-year old hardware, and gluing it all together with code in Python, C, and Make."
