description: "A simple query language is often more usable than a gigantic search form. A small domain-specific language can sometimes be much more succinct and expressive than a method-driven API. Parsing and language implementation belong in the toolbox of every working programmer.\n\nUnfortunately, the first time most of us encounter parser construction, it's in an academic setting that surveys the entire sophisticated and rather daunting field. This makes it easy to mistake language implementation for a specialist area, when in fact, parsers for even very complex languages can be built in plain C# using just a few simple patterns.\n\nCome along to this session to level-up your language implementation skills. We'll distill the nature of the task, the essential techniques on hand, and build a parser using tools you can introduce into your real-world applications and libraries.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
