title: 'Code Review Etiquettes 101 - Janani Subbiah'
recordingDate: 1561374245
description: "On most software projects, developers spend a good chunk of their time doing code reviews. These are a great opportunity to provide positive and impactful feedback.\n\nMore often than not it is up to the person whose code is under review to read and interpret code review comments, which makes it very important to consider the structure, tone and value of these comments. Things as simple as saying \"we could change this\" instead of \"you should change this\" and asking for feedback on a suggestion (e.g.: \"I think this could be implemented using tool X. What are your thoughts on that?\") go a long way in ensuring that the comment and the reviewer are received in a positive light. In this talk I will share code review practices that I have found helpful during my tenure as a software engineer.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
