description: "A New Secure Container Solution on Arm Platform: gVisor - Bin Lu, Arm \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) ) \n\nGoogle has released gVisor in 2018, a new kind of sandbox that can be used to provide secure   isolation for containers that is less resource intensive than running a full virtual machine (VM).     At its core, gVisor is an open source user-space kernel, written in Go,  that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system surface.  It includes an Open Container Initiative (OCI) runtime called runsc that provides an isolation boundary between the application and the host kernel.   The runsc runtime integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, making it simple to run sandboxed container.    Now, we have enabled gVisor on Arm64 platform. In this presentation, we will introduce and show our progress.   Also, we will show a demo of gVisor on Arm64 platform (ptrace & kvm).  \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrsg"
