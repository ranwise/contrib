description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nThere are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out. But things are changing, if you can do `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs` or make an API call, you can now do AI.\n\nIn this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs.\n\nYou don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.\n\nAbout Asim Hussain\nAsim is a developer, trainer, author and speaker with over 17 years experience working for organisations such as the European Space Agency, Google and now Microsoft, where he is a Senior Cloud Developer Advocate.\n\nHe's also co-organiser of the @aijavascript London Meetup, co-creator of aijs.rocks and member of the W3C WebMachineLearning Community Group."
