description: "Network Visibility in Hybrid and Multi Clouds - Suresh Kumar Anaparti & Harikrishna Patnala, Accelerite \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nNetworks in the Hybrid/Multi Cloud deployments across data centers are complex to monitor and troubleshoot. Diversity of network providers and multi-vendor appliances compound the validation of policy enforcement with finer details.    Network Visibility platform enables understanding traffic patterns, performance and policy compliance in the network. Also, smart audits can be performed over discrete networks through machine intelligence minimising human intervention. Cloud Network Admins would be able to quickly root cause with granular details that can feed into reactively redesigning network policies/rules.    In this presentation, Suresh will introduce the concepts of Network Visibility in Hybrid and Multi Cloud environments, strategies for Cloud Admins to leverage visibility platforms, supported by realtime customer use cases based on his experience in the live CloudStack deployments. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrvC"
