title: 'Evan You: Seeking the Balance in Framework Design with Vue | JSConf.Asia 2019'
language: English
recordingDate: 1562161285
description: "As the author of Vue, I often get asked on how the major JavaScript frameworks today differ from one another. Typically people expect technical details: size, performance, ecosystem... but to me, what fundamentally differentiates frameworks from one another is where a framework lands on the primitives vs. conventions spectrum. This is usually a conscious design decision, and the major frameworks we see today manifests three different segments of this spectrum. In this talk I'll discuss how these design choices have affected the adoption and growth of these frameworks, and why there might not be one single optimal balance point.\n\nEvan is an independent open source developer. He created Vue.js, a popular frontend framework and now works on it full-time. Before going full-time open source, Evan worked as a core dev at Meteor, and before that as a creative technologist at Google Creative Lab.\n              \n\n\nJSConf.Asia - LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore - 15 June 2019\n\nSource: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
