description: "Journey from Monolith to Microservices: Adopting a Service Mesh Approach\n\nSpeakers: Marco Palladino(Kong)\n\nMarco Palladino is an inventor, software developer and Internet entrepreneur based in San Francisco. As the CTO and co-founder of Kong, he is Kong’s co-author, responsible for the design and delivery of the company’s products, while also providing technical thought leadership around APIs and microservices within both Kong and the external software community. Prior to Kong, Marco co-founded Mashape in 2010, which became the largest API marketplace and was acquired by RapidAPI in 2017.\n\nJourney from Monolith to Microservices: Adopting a Service Mesh Approach\n\nAs organizations begin to transition from traditional monoliths to microservices, service mesh is emerging as a popular architectural pattern. Adopting a service mesh pattern makes sense for many teams/organizations, but it might not for others. When does a service mesh approach make sense, what are best practices for deploying a service mesh and how do you prepare for the future of service mesh? In this session, Kong CTO and Co-Founder Marco Palladino will explore service mesh from a practical standpoint – what to consider when adopting service mesh, including technical requirements, and key strategies for successful implementation. He will also discuss the future of service mesh and other emerging patterns in today’s increasingly hybrid, multi-cloud world.\n\nEvent Page: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
