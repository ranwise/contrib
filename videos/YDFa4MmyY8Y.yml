description: "Speaker: Anil Thaplar (Citi)\n\nAnil Thaplar is VP, lead engineer with tremendous Exuberance for typed functional programming. He is developing purely functional solutions with Scala cats library at Citigroup, Singapore.  He wants to spread his passion for functional programming. Scala language newsletter, Scalatimes has raved his blog on functional programming. He is passionate about community work and served as an organizer for Erlang meetup in Singapore.\n\nMarvels of functional programming: Launching Iron man with monads\n\nMonads have made there way in every modern programming languages yet monads have the reputation of “difficult to comprehend”. In this talk, I am seeking to change that notion. Monads are simple abstractions we will explore by composing marvels and functional programming, with a marvels case study, gradually unpacking concepts such as expressions, sum types, effects programming, composition, and monads. It is imperative for a programmer especially wanting to program in a functional paradigm to develop a solid understanding of monads.\nJavascript, Java, C#, Scala, Kotlin and plethora of others have monads. Just to name a few,\n\nA Promise in Javascript is a continuation monad.\nLINQ in C# is heavily based on sequence monad.\nJava has optional and Streams as monads.\nIn Scala, every Type supporting for-comprehension is a monad.\nWe will discover Marvels Adventure is Marvels ﹥﹥﹦Functional programming, where ﹥﹥﹦ is a monadic bind operator.\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
