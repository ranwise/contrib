language: English
recordingDate: 1561067264
description: "During this May 2019 meetup in San Francisco, Uber engineers Marie-Camille Achard and Camilla Nawaz, explain city cores. Uber often focuses our analyses, experiments, and products on these places where our ridesharing business is the densest. \n\nIn the past, these were often manually drawn. Using H3 hexagon grid and computer vision techniques, the team has created a data-driven set of core areas."
