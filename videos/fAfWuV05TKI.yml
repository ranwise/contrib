description: "The information security domain, now infamously called cybersecurity, is constantly evolving and has quite changed in the last decade in order to provide more and more sophisticated, (bug-free) and complete tools. Their number and quality has both increased but as the security people are still not (great) developers, the same mistakes still live on especially regarding the ease of installation, maintenance, and last but not least the ability to scale.\n\nThe main goal of this talk is to take a step back from this last decade of awesome tool tailoring, by presenting the results of a quantitative study on 2000+ of them, as well as giving key advice to make your tool great (again)."
