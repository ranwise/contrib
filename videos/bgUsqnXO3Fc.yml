description: "Building Apps with Containers, Functions and Managed Services - Patrick Chanezon & Scott Coulton, Microsoft \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nCloud native applications are composed of many technologies and components, but three canonical abstraction emerged in the past few years that help developers structure their architecture: container, functions responding to events, and managed services.    This talk will explain how to develop (Docker, local Kubernetes, virtual Kubelet, OpenFaaS), deploy (managed Kubernetes, functions and services) and package (CNAB specification and tooling) applications using these three components and look at not only deployment workflows but also at day 2 concerns that a developer would need to consider in the cloud native landscape.     We will demo every topic and a Github repository will be available for developers to reproduce the demos and learn at their own pace.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrll"
