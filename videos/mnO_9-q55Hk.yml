description: "Continues Integration Practices for Zephyr Upstream - Hake Huang, NXP Semiconductor Inc \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nContinues integration(CI) is getting popular in many open source projects. There are many successful open source projects which can support CI. However, how to integrate existing open source projects and build an efficient CI pipeline is getting importance, as the project is getting much more complex. Hereinafter, we present how NXP zephyr Devops system works for NXP upstream augment testing. The proposed system contains several subsystems based on several popular open source projects, including building an internal cloudy build system with zephyr Docker file, and linking this Docker image with Jenkins Docker, a scheduler system for multiply board testing as well as virtualization validation system. and some glue scripts. With this system setting, we build up a CI system with minimum supporting resources and high reliable quality tracking and validation for upstream patches    \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrv0"
