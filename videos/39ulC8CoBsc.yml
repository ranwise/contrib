description: 'We’ve, as humans, been programming only for the past few decades. We’ve come a long way in some ways, yet we’ve advanced only marginally on other fronts. We hear folks tell us, ‘oh, things change so fast’ and yet we’ve changed only a little in the way we develop software. Imagine where we’d be, if only von Newman had not put that bottleneck in computing… It takes a long time for the software developers to change. The last big changed happened about 20 years ago. We’re poised for the next big change. In this presentation we’ll learn about the perfect storms that’s influencing that change and the directions that the programming field is evolving in.'
