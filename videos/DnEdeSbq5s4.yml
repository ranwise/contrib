description: "Upgrading Your Service Mesh to Linkerd 2 - Tilen Faganel, Open Credo ltd. \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nService meshes are advancing at an incredible rate. And thereâ€™s no sign of it slowing down. Unfortunately sometimes that means breaking changes occur, which might make updates to the service mesh difficult and potentially disruptive. Particularly if you were an early adaptor.    Linkerd 2 was a major update. So big, in fact, most of everything about it changed. Upgrading an existing Linkerd 1 deployment can be pretty daunting, as we need to redesign our service mesh architecture and configuration. All while ensuring the upgrade is performed successfully, reliably and without major disruptions.    Come and join me as we will go through a journey of how we helped a client fully upgrade their service mesh from Linkerd 1. And how nobody noticed! We will explore the challenges and pitfalls of doing so, which can be applied to any upgrade of this caliber. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrpp"
