description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nWe’ve all had that experience where we’ve planned the perfect discussion only to have it hijacked by a passionate side-person, lose focus halfway through, or produce the exact same takeaways as you had before you began the discussion.\n\nWith a few tricks in your back pocket, you can recover from some of these tricky situations or even prevent them in the first place! I’ll share some of my best techniques and provide some yellow flags I’ve learned to recognize that signified needing to make a change.\n\nAbout Neha Batra\nNeha Batra is an engineering manager at GitHub who, 6 years ago, was an energy consultant and quit to teach herself programming because “it was time\". She holds a bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from MIT and enjoys foodie adventures, planning trips (and has gdocs for most of her trip plans), and collecting national park magnets. If you want to hear her ramble on a topic, ask her about pair programming, how she likes managing, or how much she misses Miami."
