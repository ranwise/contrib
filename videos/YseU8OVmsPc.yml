description: "Multi-tenancy & Blockchain: Deploying Hyperledger Fabric on Kubernetes - Tong Li, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHyperledger Fabric is an open-source enterprise-grade Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platform designed primarily for permissioned blockchains. It provides developers a framework for building blockchain applications. Deploying a multi-component system like Hyperledger Fabric to production is challenging.  Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a portable, extensible open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It supports multi tenancy, which makes it possible for developers to develop and test blockchain applications efficiently.  Attendees will learn all about Hyperledger Fabric and Kubernetes and how when used collectively, Hyperledger and Kubernetes offer a powerful, secure platform for processing blockchain transactions. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrsL"
