description: "Modern fuzzing techniques including code coverage driven, syntax description, passive and active combination and so on are well proved.\n\nIn Blackhat Europe 2018 I introduced PanicXNU v1, the smart active fuzzer for macOS syscall, which is based on google’s syzkaller. In this talk, I would like to introduce PanicXNU v3 – the new version of my smart fuzzer that adds support for smart IOKit fuzzing and passive fuzzing. By using PanicXNU, I have already found more than 60 unique kernel crashes and received several CVEs including 2 for MacOS in Pwn2Own.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n    Syscall fuzzing.\n    Active IOKit fuzzing.\n    Passive IOKit fuzzing.\n    Fuzzing visualization.\n\nThe project’s mission is to smart fuzz every corner in Apple kernel."
