description: "When Kent Beck started at Facebook in 2011, he noticed that engineers at the company were using a planned, waterfall approach to software development, an approach he thought he killed 20 years ago in favor of iterative development.  This made him wonder: What if these engineers are solving a different problem than the one that he's solving? And what does successful planned development look like? In this talk, Beck introduces \"3X\", a model that suggests that there are three different universes of software product development with different laws.  \n\nKent Beck is the author of the best-seller “Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change.”  He was also a pioneer of patterns for software development, test-driven development, Extreme Programming, and the JUnit test framework.  Currently, Beck is a Technical Coach at Facebook."
