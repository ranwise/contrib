Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHyperledger Cello (HLC) is a blockchain provisioning and operational system, which helps people use and manage blockchains in an efficient way. It supports multiple infrastructure including Docker, Kubernetes, vSphere and Swarm. Using Cello, blockchain developers and operators can build up a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform quickly from scratch.    In this talk, the speakers will introduce key features of Hyperledger Cello and demo how it can be used to manage the deployment of Hyperledger Fabric and chaincode lifecycle. In addition, the monitoring of a blockchain platform will be showcased. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrvO"
