description: "Machine Learning and the IoT are a match made in heaven. After all, IoT devices collect mountains of sensor data, what better way to uncover insights and actions than through sophisticated, modern computing methods like ML and AI?\n\nThe problem is, leveraging ML with IoT has historically meant backhauling all your sensor data to the Cloud. When the cloud is involved, security is a concern, and in the realm of IoT, security is often a dirty word.\n\nBut modern embedded systems, microcontrollers and single-board computers are getting more powerful, and more sophisticated, and its becoming increasingly possible to bring Machine Learning closer to sensors and IoT devices. \"Edge ML\" enables quicker insights, tighter security, and even true predictive action, and it's going to become the norm in the IoT in the near future.\n\nIn this session, we'll explore the state of the art in Edge ML and IoT, and talk about practical ways that developers can get started with both, today.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
