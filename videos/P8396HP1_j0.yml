description: "Debugging Kubernetes Controllers from IDE - Surendhar Ravichandran, F5 Networks \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThis talk covers different patterns that a kubernetes developer can use to debug a custom controller. To some extent, the same methods can be used by application developers to debug their code. Ranging from docker, minikube, to a full blow production cluster, this talk will showcase how to make minimal changes to your existing workflow and create controllers with debug support. Solutions to overcome networking difficulties between development environment and controller will also be addressed.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrnD"
