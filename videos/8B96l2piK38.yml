description: "Ever wondered why some people prefer to work alone? Or why some people cringe when pair programming is mentioned? \nIt might be that that person, like me, is an introvert. But is is really that simple? \nCan we really put every person in a box labeled \"introvert\" or \"extravert\" or are we all just ambiverts?\n\nDuring this session I will talk about introverts, extraverts and everything in between. \nDrawing from almost 15 years of personal experience being an introvert on agile teams I will talk about the differences of being an extravert or an introvert and how to foster an inclusive team environment.\n\nTobias Anderberg is based in Kristianstad but is working for the Stockholm-based company Agical, \nTobias has been working as a developer, mentor and coach in Agile methods since 2004. \nHe loves sharing his knowledge and has since 2015 co-hosted the bi-weekly podcast 'Väg 74', about software development and teams, together with friend and colleague Ola Ellnestam.\n\n______\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
