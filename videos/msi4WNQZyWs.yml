title: 'The Curiously Recurring Pattern of Coupled Types - Adi Shavit and Björn Fahller'
recordingDate: 1562319550
description: "Why can pointers be subtracted but not added?\n\nWhat do raw C pointers, STL iterators, std::chrono types, and 2D/3D geometric primitives have in common?\n\nIn this talk we will present some curiously coupled data types that frequently occur in your programs, together forming notions that you are already intuitively familiar with. We will shine a light on the mathematical notion of Affine Spaces, and how they guide stronger design. We will review the properties of affine spaces and show how they improve program semantics, stronger type safety and compile time enforcement of these semantics.\n\nBy showing motivational examples, we will introduce you to the mathematical notion of affine spaces. The main focus will then be on how affine space types and their well defined semantics shape expressive APIs.\n\nWe will give examples and guidelines for creating your own affine types. Although the examples in the talk will use C++, the general concepts are applicable to other strongly typed programming languages.\n\n\n\nDon't forget to check out Adi Shavit's and Björn Fahller's next talks at this year's NDC Techtown:\nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://ndctechtown.com/speakers/\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
