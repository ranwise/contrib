description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nAuthorisation is typically associated with a single act of “logging in”. But nobody likes to login too often, so most websites have a “remember me” option. But it’s not very safe to be constantly logged in. How to accommodate contradictory goals of good UX and high security? At Digital Fingerprints, we believe it can be solved using passive biometrics in tandem with stream processing. During the talk you can learn what technical challenges occured during designing and implementing continuous authorisation solution that uses thousands of machine learning models to provide seamless user experience with increased security. Key takeaways: • What is passive biometrics? • How continuous authorisation works? • How to meet tight latency requirements? • Is it possible to serve thousands of machine learning models? • Ways to provide privacy of data and privacy of models. • How Apache Flink fits into that kind of system?\_\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
