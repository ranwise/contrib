See more in the full description.\n\nOur thanks to the staff at YouTube for giving us their time.\n\nCharacters, Symbols & the Unicode Miracle: http://youtu.be/MijmeoH9LT4 \nYouTube's Secret Algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsCeNCVb-d8\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nVideo by Sean Riley and Brady Haran.\n\nNOTE ONE: This was filmed at YouTube HQ in San Bruno. It was filmed before the much-discussed changes were made to YouTube comments section - we have not asked questions about that.\n\nNOTE TWO: This is a Computerphile video - it was NOT made by YouTube or reflect the company's official views. Staff were kind enough to answer some of our questions (well, most of them), but they did not edit the video or \"approve\" it - any mistakes in the editing or animations are most likely our own.\n\nNOTE THREE: A video about the YouTube algorithm (how videos are recommended) is coming soon to Computerphile - so you really should subscribe.\n\nNOTE FOUR: The snowboarder is Sean!\n\nNOTE FIVE: Music on snowboarding film courtesy Hudson Super Six \nhttp://www.facebook.com/hudson.supersix\n\nNOTE SIX: Error on the graphics where it says 320p - actually should read 360p\n\nWhy views stick at 301: http://youtu.be/oIkhgagvrjI"
