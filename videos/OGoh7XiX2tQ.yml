description: "Integration of Edge and Cloud IoT Platforms - Drasko Draskovic & Janko Isidorovic, Mainflux \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nAs network processing functions move towards the edge, it becomes important that IoT middleware enables connectivity, device management and data filtering in the form of IoT platform running most often on the IoT gateway HW. However, these gateways must be controlled and managed from a cloud application, and they themselves become \"things\" in the larger IoT-schema. Moreover, cloud IoT platform should also aggregate and store data from thes gateways and devices connected to them, but also the data of other devices - sensors and actuators that directly connect to cloud, without a need for an intermediary gateway.    Using an example of LF EdgeX Foundry project for IoT gateways and Mainflux project as a cloud IoT platform for gateway management, we will present a typical architecture of an end-to-end open-source source solution for IoT edge-fog-cloud continuum. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrul"
