description: 'For many of us, when navigating the web, we only ever encounter elements of the web to be left-aligned. But actually, they are start-aligned! In right-to-left languages like Hebrew, Arabic or Persian, the same settings are right-aligned. That is the beauty of the web: It allows us to deliver our content to both writing directions. That is why structuring our CSS layouts in a logical way rather than with physical direction way can help us to write code that works across languages. This talk will explain how CSS logical properties make that even easier.'
