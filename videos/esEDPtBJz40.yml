recordingDate: 1561980517
description: "In this session I will show you how with just a few lines of code you can make your applications much more resilient and reliable. With Polly, the .NET resilience framework, your application can easily tolerate transient faults and longer outages in remote systems or infrastructure.\n\nAt the end of this hour you will know how to use all the features of Polly to make your application a rock solid piece of work. Weâ€™ll cover the reactive and proactive resilience strategies, starting with simple but very powerful retries and finishing with bulkhead isolation.\n\nOh, and did I mention Polly is a .NET Standard library so it will work on any application you can think of! \n\nJoin me for an hour, and your applications will never be the same.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
