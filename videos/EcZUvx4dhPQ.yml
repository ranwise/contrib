description: "Analytics for the masses\nCogility has built a declarative, zero-coding, Flink based, general purpose analytics platform aimed at supporting subject matter experts. It features an editor, that allows users to build a blueprint (template) of the data-pattern they are looking for and our system generates complete Flink jobs that look for the desired events in real-time. These templates can be chained to detect higher-level patterns from the data. One of the applications of our platform is in the law enforcement space, where analysts with domain understanding & no programming ability, created templates to detect & monitor complex behaviours from county-jail & public-safety data successfully.\n\nFlink Forward San Francisco 2019\n#flinkforward"
