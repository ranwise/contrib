Before he was focused on helping companies understand and enable their development teams, Alex was our Vice President of Operations, responsible for scaling the operations and building the internal culture and workflow of Stack Overflow. He joined Stack Overflow with operations experience for a variety of startups and media properties, including Yext, TechCrunch50, This Week in Startups, Kevin Pollak’s Chat Show and many more.\n\nBuilding & Leveraging Your Internal Developer Community\n\nThe power of public communities like Github and Stack Overflow has been proven by their scale: Github has over 28 million users and 57 million repositories, and Stack Overflow is one of the most popular websites in the world. But how can companies build culture and community inside their organizations, effectively harnessing that power internally? What are the secrets to getting teams to collaborate better and ship faster? Stack Overflow’s General Manager will dive into the benefits of internal communities, and he will share strategies for maximizing collaboration and efficiency based on lessons and data from Stack Overflow’s 10 year history.\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
