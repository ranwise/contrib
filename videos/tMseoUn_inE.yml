description: "Intro + Deep Dive: CoreDNS - Yong Tang, MobileIron \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBest known for its ability to serve as the cluster DNS for Kubernetes, CoreDNS is a plugin-based DNS server that is easy to use and extend, either through the configuration of Corefile, or by adding new plugins in Golang. In the Intro part, we will update the current state and the road map of CoreDNS. We will share feedbacks from the community about CoreDNS integration since Kubernetes 1.13, especially the performance enhancements which has been the focus recently. We will also discuss the cloud support of CoreDNS with AWS, and the planned GCP and Azure support. At the end of the session, some common use cases with cloud support will be discussed to help audience getting started with CoreDNS.    In this deep dive part, we will demo a simplified version of a service discovery plugin. By walking through the complete code of this plugin and demo the user case, we will showcase the ease of convenience to add new plugins for new functionalities in CoreDNS. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrqb"
