description: "Speaker: Andrew Harvey (Microsoft)\n\nAndrew Harvey is CTO in Residence in Sydney for Microsoft. He works with startups of all sizes to help them scale their product and technology.\n\nIn his own words, I have previously spoken on CoreML at Yow! Connected conference, given a talk and workshop on building functional firmware with Nerves at Yow! LambdaJam. I also have run multiple meetups, as well as speaking for Microsoft at various events\n\nYour Team as a Distributed System\n\nAs we level up in technical roles, often we find ourselve thrust into team leadership and management. This sneaks up on us and we can be left without the skills to adequately understand, engage with and lead our teams. This inevitably has a negative effect on our teams and this effect is multiplied as you scale.\n\nWhat if we could reach into our toolbox that we use to understand technical problems – software architecture and distributed systems theory – to help us understand our teams? Could we learn to better manage people through this metaphor?\n\nWe will explore the dynamics of teams and how they map to our understanding of distributed systems. Using this understanding we can apply distributed systems theory to help unpick some of the dynamics of our teams and how to optimise them for scale.\n\nFrom communcation to culture, we will break down the components of our distributed system and see what makes it tick using things like CAP Theorem and the 8 Fallacies of Distributed Systems. You will walk away with some tools to help understand your team, and set yourself up for successful scaling.\n\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
