description: "For the last 3 years, the Apache Arrow project has been developing a language-independent open standard in-memory format for tabular data and a library ecosystem that builds on top of the format. In this talk I will discuss the current status of the project and Ursa Labs, a new not-for-profit development group I founded to focus on Arrow development. I will give a preview of our Arrow development roadmap for 2019 and how it may impact the Python data science ecosystem\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
