description: "A robot is a great tool to show what the programming can do. In the talk, I’ll share my experience in making several projects with kids of different age using a BB-8 robot. We’ll also do a little project together to see how much fun a programming lesson can bring.\n\nI would like to tell when it’s better to start teaching programming to kids.\nExplain how to encourage and behave with kids when teaching.\nPropose several ideas of involving games for a small group of kids.\nTogether with the volunteers we’ll make a demo game-lesson.\nAdvice, how to make programming interesting and inspiring for the older ones (if the time is left)."
