Did you get cash from an ATM this week? Buy something online? Or pick up a prescription? A cryptographic algorithm was needed to make it happen!\n\nIncreasingly, developers need to become familiar with the essentials of encryption. But MD5, bcrypt, DES, AES, SSL, digital signatures, public keys - what are they for, and why do we care?\n\nArmed with only a vanilla Rails application and beginner-level Ruby code, this talk will demonstrate the key ideas in modern cryptography. We will also take a peek ahead to quantum computing and its implications on cryptography."
