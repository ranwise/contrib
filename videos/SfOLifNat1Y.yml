description: "Keynote: Stitching Things Together - Dan Kohn, Executive Director, Cloud Native Computing Foundation \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWhy are similar technologies often developed independently at the same time? Why has Kubernetes become so popular? Dan will take a very quick tour of some surprising science and technology history and suggest some answers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Qa7X"
