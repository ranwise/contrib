description: "Developing Open Source for Safety and Security - Kate Stewart, Linux Foundation \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nOpen source projects thrive when they can accept great ideas and developers are able to extend the code to “scratch their itch”. Developing safety critical applications, on the other hand, requires rigorous processes to make sure they won’t fail in critical ways and there’s a high threshold before change is accepted. Linux and Zephyr are both working towards achieving Safety Certifications with different approaches. Zephyr is designed for devices where Linux is too big to fit, or have long battery life needs. This talk will summarize the current state of Zephyr and the project’s plans for going after Functional Safety certifications in 2019 while still handling any potential security issues. This will be contrasted with the ELISA project and how the team on ELISA is working towards new processes and tools to help Linux become certified for use in functional safety applications. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrsj"
