description: "Over the past couple of years, PyTorch has been increasing in popularity in the Deep Learning community. What was initially a tool for Deep Learning researchers has been making headway in industry settings.\n\nIn this session, we will cover how to create Deep Neural Networks using the PyTorch framework on a variety of examples. The material will range from beginner - understanding what is going on \"under the hood\", coding the layers of our networks, and implementing backpropagation - to more advanced material on RNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, & GRUs. Time permitting, we may also spend some time covering the fast.ai library that also uses PyTorch.\n\nAttendees will leave with a better understanding of the PyTorch framework. In particular, how it differs from Tensorflow. Furthermore, a link to a clean documented GitHub repo with the solutions of the examples covered will be provided.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
