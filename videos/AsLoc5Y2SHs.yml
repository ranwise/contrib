description: "Full title: How we use Reinforcement Learning to solve the abbey of the crime\n\nDo you know the Abbey of the Crime?\n\nThe abbey is an 8-bit game (for spectrum and CPC) that became the first RPG game in 3D (2.5D) in 1987.\n\nThis game is a marvel from a technological point of view: in only less than 120k it is capable of storing the sound, the images, all the logic of the program and the data.\n\nDid you manage to finish the game without help?\n\nI do not know any human being who has passed it without help. It is one of the most complicated games that have been developed, like a 1000x compared to the revenge of Montezuma from Atari. The complexity is around (10 ** 10000)\n\nIn the talk we will tell how we design and build an AI capable of playing alone and learn to complete the game."
