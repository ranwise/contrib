description: "With around 720.000 customers, Hafslund Nett is Norwayâ€™s largest power grid company and the fifth-largest in the Nordic region. The IT department have been migrating all of their services onto kubernetes. This introduces a set of challenges to keep control without sacrificing agility or speed.\n\nThis talk will show how Hafslund Nett decided to use a Cloud Managed Kubernetes with RBAC and AD groups to get fine grained control, secure development projects, use namespaces to control worker nodes usage and how we ended on separated Kubernetes clusters for each cluster environment. Additionally OpenIDConnect is used to provide the customers facing applications with B2C capabilities.\n\nWe will show how the centralizing of logs enable us to do monitoring, display trends, optimizing resource usage, improve Kubernetes scheduling and feed the CI/CD pipelines to further improve the container services.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
