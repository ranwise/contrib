description: "Cost-Effective Scheduling of a Massive Number of Containers in Kubernetes - Yuan Chen, JD.com \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nJD runs one of the largest Kubernetes clusters in production in the world, supporting a wide range of workloads from e-commerce services to big data and machine learning jobs. The massive scale and complexity requires efficient scheduling to address the scalability and cost-effectiveness challenges.     JD’s Chief Architect, Haifeng Liu, will present how JD overcomes hurdles to improve its Kubernetes Clusters’ resource utilization and cost efficiency through advanced scheduling, including fine-grained monetization and monitoring of resource usage, machine learning-driven resource allocation, co-scheduling of mixed workloads and millisecond-level elastic scaling. Specifically, Haifeng will describe Archimedes - JD's Kubernetes scheduling system, and how it handled an extreme demand with $24.7 billion of transactions on JD's Kubernetes platform during JD's June 18 anniversary sale event. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrm3"
