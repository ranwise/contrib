description: "Performing Infrastructure Migrations at Scale - Melanie Cebula, Airbnb \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) ) \n\nEveryone is excited to adopt the latest technology trends, but how do you migrate from one technology to another when you have high availability requirements? How do you separate hype from a technology that actually works at your scale? This talk aims to solve both:    1. the business problems of justifying and resourcing infrastructure migrations and managing the migration lifecycle    2. the technical problems of initial prototyping, identifying and solving blockers and gotchas, giving best practices for rollout, and automating migrations with infrastructure as code.    This talk will be backed by our case study migrating hundreds of legacy services with strict latency and uptime requirements to Kubernetes at Airbnb. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrmL"
