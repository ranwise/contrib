description: "At Prodo.AI, we’re teaching machines to write code for humans. Using the latest in Deep Learning techniques, we can generate code that’s not just functional, but beautiful. Our goal is to make the computer do the heavy lifting so you can concentrate on the important things: being creative, solving problems, and having fun.We’ve tried a hundred different ways of encoding the knowledge of how to write code. In this talk, Samir will take you through a tour of the different techniques, architectures and optimisations we’ve tried in the process of teaching a machine to write code, using neural networks, simulations and everything in between.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNewcrafts Conference 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSamir Talwar \n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons license."
