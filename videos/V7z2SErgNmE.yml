His design strengths are in cloud computing, automation, and security space.\n\nKubernetes security 101\n\nIn this talk, we will look at the different layers of security that can be applied to a Kubernetes orchestrated container environment and the different team’s responsibility in the platform to deliver security. From the sysadmin’s point of view, how do I make sure Kubernetes is secured, what official hardening guides are out there to follow. From an application developers point of view, how does secomp/appapparmor work ? To make sure that only the right processes from the application have access to the host machine. Now that we have the local container secured, how do we make sure our deployments follow the same structure and security profiles. Can we add security checks to our container CD pipeline like we would quality gates? Lastly, we will look at it from the point of the security team. How can they have input to all the steps we have taken from the beginning of the process and not the end? Allowing all the teams to work together breaking down silo to deliver a solution.\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
