description: "We train our models using annotated data every day, however, most of us have very little knowledge on how to accurately and effectively create high-quality datasets.\n\nIn this talk we will explore the different options for getting annotations and how to set up tooling and metrics (using Prodigy as an example). In addition, we will review methods for getting accurate and clean datasets, while answering these questions: - Active or passive learning? - Internal experts or mass-scale mechanical turks? - One big task or many small ones? How to break it up? - Evaluating agreement and quality of the annotations using Kappa scores\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
