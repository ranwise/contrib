description: "Zowe - To Open Source and Beyond! - Ivy Li & Ashley Li, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThis talk covers the challenges customers have faced with obtaining and deploying tooling for their mainframe developers and system programmers over the last 50 years. The Open Mainframe Project is working with ISVs and developers to address this and create modern platforms and frameworks by bringing open source languages and tooling to the mainframe. At this session, attendees will learn how a blend of open source tools together with the new Zowe open source framework empowers mainframe developers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrsd"
