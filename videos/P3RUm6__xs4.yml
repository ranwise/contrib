description: "Is Rust ready for the embedded world yet? If your IOT project is on ARM or MSP430, it already has native support in the Rust compiler, and AVR and RISC-V have compiler forks available. But architecture support is only the first challenge: If you're used to writing Rust for hosts that run an operating system, the paradigm shift of having to do everything yourself in the embedded world can be jarring. This talk will introduce the basic techniques for writing Rust to run microcontrollers, and survey outstanding embedded rust projects already available in the ecosystem. \n\nEVENT:\n\nlinux.conf.au 2019 â€” Christchurch, New Zealand\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nE.
