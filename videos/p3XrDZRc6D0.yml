Ltd \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIn collaborative project development, it is important to get an insight of the open source software, to determine involved licensing and license obligations. FOSSology is a software project that is specialized in identifying license relevant statements. It can also scan source code for Copyright notices, Keywords and Export control relevant statements. FOSSology lets users generate compliance documentation according to the organization's needs, in a variety of data formats such as SPDX tag-value, RDF.  FOSSology, is a Linux Foundation collaboration project, licensed under the GPL-2.0.  Recently, new technology has been introduced for FOSSology, which is going towards more automation by providing a REST API for example. New scanning approaches have been developed which enables more automation at imprecise licensing. This presentation explains how users of FOSSology can use the new features. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrv6"
