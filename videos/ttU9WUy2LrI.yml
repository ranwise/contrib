description: "Full Title: How to expand your NLP solution to new languages using transfer learning\n\nExpanding NLP models to new languages typically involves annotating completely new data sets for each language which is time and resource-expensive. To avoid these tedious and costly tasks, we use cross-lingual embeddings to enable knowledge transfer from languages with sufficient training data to low-resource languages. Cross-lingual embeddings aim to represent words in multiple languages in a shared vector space by capturing semantic similarities across languages. In this talk, you will hear about our experience with learning cross-lingual embeddings for a sequence labelling task, namely multilingual CV (resume) parsing.\n\nDuring the presentation, you'll see how to apply transfer learning to do document parsing on low resource languages. We will show you where the approach works well and why and we’ll discuss the challenges of training domain-specific cross-lingual embeddings as well as elaborate on the different factors that affect the quality of the embeddings. Finally, we will discuss what we learned and we’ll show the workflow of creating your own cross-lingual system.\n\nWe will cover the following topics:\n\nSensitivity of cross-lingual embeddings to the choice of the bilingual lexicon. Since our application focuses on the specific domain of human resources, we will show how adding domain-specific terms to the bilingual lexicons improves the downstream performance.\nWhat can be achieved with cross-lingual embeddings in a zero-shot setting and what do we gain by adding a little data from the low-resource language.\nComparison of data sampling strategies for the multilingual training setup.\nIntrinsic and extrinsic evaluation: How can intrinsic metrics help to get insights about the cross-lingual model and predict the downstream task performance.\nLessons learned working with different language groups.\nYou will leave this talk having heard some concrete recommendations on creating cross-lingual embeddings for sequence labeling, based on our experimental results. Moreover, you will learn more about the pitfalls and crucial details to pay attention to when developing such a cross-lingual system.\n\nThis talk will be most useful for those looking to expand their existing system to new languages, including low resource.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
