description: "How did punch card systems work? Professor Brailsford delves further into the era of mainframe computing with this hands-on look at punch cards.\n\nExtra Material on Punch Cards: http://youtu.be/lkSGMrH5Kic\nExtra Material - behind the scenes: http://youtu.be/Wi326Leuemg\n\nMainframes to Unix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rPPqm44xLs\nNear to the Metal: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNuFVq5QeRk\n\nAddendum: \"ICL punched cards actually have 12 rows -- not 11 as stated in the film. Choosing any two hole positions out of 12 gives 66 combinations -- which can represent 66 different characters. This in turn is more than enough for the 64 possibilities of a 6-bit character held in ICL computer memory. Also, some special characters could actually utilise three hole configurations adding further to the possibilities.\" \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
