language: English
recordingDate: 1560815534
description: "Abstract:\nLearn how to build a client-side chatbot with Oracle JET, on top of contextual chatbot model, which is implemented with TensorFlow Learn library using deep neural network model. Context is king while talking about intelligent chatbots. It is essential to keep context. Otherwise, the conversation becomes useless. This session will focus on three areas - user intent processing with TensorFlow machine learning, conversation context tracking, and chatbot UI implementation with Oracle JET. Communication between JET client side and TensorFlow is implemented through REST with Flask microframework for Python."
