description: "Asyncronous Streams feature document\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/async-streams.md\n\nReactive Extensions and System.Linq.Async on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/reactive\n\nSystem.Linq.Async on NuGet\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Linq.Async\n\nWith IAsyncEnumerable being introduced in .NET Core 3, it's not surprising that developers might want to leverage their existing knowledge of Linq operations when working with async streams.\n\nIn this episode, Bart De Smet comes on to talk about the System.Linq.Async nuget package that adds some common Linq query operators to IAsyncEnumerable.\n\n[01:15] - What's the history behind IAsyncEnumerable?\n[02:17] - How does the new IAsyncEnumerable compare to the previous?\n[03:39] - Can IAsyncEnumerable scale to large systems?\n[06:15 ] - How do the ways we partition work with IAsyncEnumerable differ from IEnumerable?\n[08:34] - What can we make use of IAsyncEnumerable? (Demo)\n[13:03] - How can we add support for common Linq expressions to IAsyncEnumerable?\n[16:11] - How do filtering and ordering operations work with IAsyncEnumerable?\n[20:00] - How important was community support to the longevity of this project?\n[21:55] - How have the language features made code much simpler?"
