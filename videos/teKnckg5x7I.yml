description: "Зал 1, 17 мая, 11:00\nПрезентация и тезисы:\nhttps://phprussia.ru/2019/abstracts/5049\n\nPHP 7.4 is shaping up to be the most significant PHP release since PHP 7.0, featuring many long-awaited features including typed properties, return type covariance, FFI and (hopefully) short closures. Development of PHP 8.0 has also started, and the first changes are already in.\n\nThis talk will introduce the new functionality, with a focus on language and library changes in PHP 7.4 and 8.0. For a coverage of performance-related changes like opcache preloading and JIT, please see Dmitry Stogov’s talk.\n-------- \nНашли ошибку в видео? Пишите нам на support@ontico.ru"
