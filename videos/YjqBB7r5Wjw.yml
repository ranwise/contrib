description: "CNCF CloudEvents Project: A Step Towards Serverless Interop - Doug Davis, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) ) \n\nThe CloudEvents project was started to provide a first step towards Serverless interoperability by trying to define a common set of metadata, and format, for events flowing into Serverless platforms. In this session, after a brief introduction of the project, we'll discuss the status of the project, where it's being used, how people can use it via our SDKs and where we see it going in the future. Time permitting, we'll even showcase our latest demo that shows how a key industry consortium is considering using it in their critical business workflows. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrqP"
