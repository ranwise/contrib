description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nAnalysing streams of text data to extract topics is an important task for getting useful\ninsights to be leveraged in subsequent workflows. For example extracting topics from text to be\ncontinuously ingested into a search engine can be useful to tag documents with important\nkeywords or concepts to be used at search time. Another use case is doing analysis of support\ntickets to get insights on the most common problems for customers.\nIn this talk we illustrate how to use Flink's Dynamic processing capabilities to continuously train\ntopic models from unlabelled text and use such models to extract topics from the data itself.\nSuch topic models will be built leveraging distributed representations of words and documents.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
