title: 'Functional Web Programming in .Net with the SAFE Stack - Anthony Brown'
recordingDate: 1562580372
description: "The SAFE stack is an open source stack of libraries and tools which simplify the process of building type safe web applications which run on the cloud almost entirely in F#.\n\nIn this talk we'll explore the components of the SAFE stack and how they can be used to write web services and web sites in idiomatic F#. We'll see how we can manage this without needing to compromise and use object oriented frameworks whilst also still integrating with the existing ASP.Net, JavaScript and React ecosystems. We'll consider how we can write backend applications using Saturn on top of ASP.Net, we'll look at how to run F# in the web browser with Fable and we'll cover how we can develop interactive web applications leveraging the benefits of functional programming. This talk is aimed at developers who are looking to understand how they can use F# to effectively build full stack web applications.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
