description: "In this episode of Vue on Fire we are going to learn about Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL, cloud hosted, real-time database by Firebase.\nThis video provides an overview on how Firestore is structured and we are implementing a simple posting functionality where we save documents to our database and use Firestore's built-in realtime listener to listen to new documents created in our database collection.\n\nCloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development by Firebase. It offer the capability to sync data across clients through realtime listeners and also offers a degree of offline support for both, mobile and web. \n\nJoin me on my Slack community\nhttps://join.slack.com/t/piventurelab/shared_invite/enQtMzg1MTI1NTAzNDQ2LWZkM2NmYjVkNzA3NmY3ZDQ4MmI1ZThiYThiYTg3Nzg1ZmRiN2I1MTgzM2E5ZDhiMTQ0MGQ4MjVkNmZmMjFjOGI\n\nFirebase Cloud Firestore\nhttps://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore\n\n💻 Link to the Github repository\nhttps://github.com/pichsenmeister/vue-app\n\n🐦 Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/pichsenmeister\n\nπ PI Venture Lab \nhttps://piventurelab.com\n\n🌐 Personal website\nhttps://pichsenmeister.com\n\n🎵 Outro sound by Furbyguy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/nerfman300"
