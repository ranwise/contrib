description: "!!Con 2019 - Life isn’t logical! It’s hard to put NOR gates in bacteria! by Tessa Alexanian\n\nBacteria: nature’s nanobots. In response to their surroundings, bacteria chase after food, change their shape, cooperate with one another, and otherwise appear to have a fair bit of computational power hiding within their cell membranes.\n\nSynthetic biologists (like me!) love talking about the “genetic circuits” that bacteria use to make decisions, but the truth is that DNA and proteins are far more annoying circuit components than the transistors we use to build computers.\n\nLet’s look at one of the simplest (but coolest!) boolean logic gates, the NOR gate, and talk about why it’s easy to implement with transistors and hard to implement in living cells."
