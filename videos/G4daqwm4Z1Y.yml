title: 'Using Open Source Machine Learning to do Sound Recognition - Camilo Tapia'
recordingDate: 1561466012
description: "Camilo Tapia will walk you through a project from start to finish where he used TensorFlow.js to create a model that could hear the difference between two different kinds of coffee being made. What were the biggest challenges? How much data was needed and what kind of hardware was used? What can this be used for beyond listening to coffee? Camilo will go into more technical details and both speakers will be available for Q&A.\n\nCamilo Tapia, Tech Lead 24HR Malmö, has been coding since before the internet. During his career he has pioneered many techniques that we take for granted, like responsive web design and Headless CMS.\n\n_________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
