title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Andy Kitchen - Meta-quines'
recordingDate: 1562792401
description: "A quine is a program that outputs its own source code, but can you create a 2 quine, a pair of programs that output each other with an A--B--A--B cycle? What about between different languages? Can you gzip your own source code? Is there a structured way to do this with theory? All these questions will be somewhat answered, in ways that will make your head hurt... math-a-magical demos and over 9000 layers of meta-ness await!\n\nAndy Kitchen is an AI researcher with a love of functional programming and computer science. He has helped found and organise the Compose :: Melbourne conference and the Melbourne Functional Programming Association.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
