title: 'Sebastian Daschner - Cloud Native, Service-Meshed Java Enterprise With Istio'
language: English
recordingDate: 1561623388
description: "In enterprise software, we see more and more of the cloud native technologies, especially container orchestration and service meshes, emerging and slowly taking over the market. Developers are facing the challenge which technology to choose to implement microservices for a cloud native setting. Java Enterprise has been used for software solutions for a long time and its APIs are well-established in the ecosystem. However, is it possible to develop cloud native, service-meshed Java Enterprise applications that fulfill concerns such as scalability, resiliency, and telemetry — in an effective, manageable way?\n\nThis sessions shows how to implement service-meshed applications using Java EE 8 and MicroProfile. We will develop a mesh of microservices, managed by Kubernetes and Istio. We’ll see why especially the Java Enterprise approach fits the concepts behind container orchestration and service meshes well. The session also includes how to integrate the required cross-cutting concerns, such as monitoring, tracing, or resiliency into our applications, where developers have to actively integrate technology themselves and where the platform support us. Especially the cooperation between Java EE and MicroProfile provides a potent technology. All of the time will be spent live-coding while explaining the concepts and solutions."
