description: 'Spring Boot is a product from Spring, that provides many configuration
  defaults for a new Spring project, so that one can set up a project in minutes.
  However, this is only one of the many features of Spring Boot. One of its module
  also provides many important Non-Functional Requirements out-of-the-box: monitoring,
  metrics, exposing those over HTTP, etc. In this presentation, I’ll demo some of
  those, that will make DevOps more than a little happy. Comments: DevOps that don’t
  know about Spring Boot should. Out-of-the-box features are priceless and include
  metrics, healthchecks, hearbeat and more.'
