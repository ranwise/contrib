description: "DOES19 London â€” This session describes our journey to reinvent Allstate's mainframe, and how we adopted modern tooling to tackle the challenges of DevOps Day 2 head-on.\n\nFar from being a legacy platform, at Allstate the mainframe continues to innovate and drive out solutions for DevOps Day 2. Many of these solutions are being driven from mainframe teams and showcased across the enterprise. In many respects, our empowered mainframe developers are leading from the front and pioneering the way forward.\n\nAt Allstate, our mainframe modernization work shows what the DevOps future looks like. Products such as IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) and IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) give us the tools to make that happen. This session presented by IBM.\n\nAnthony Robinson, Billing Manager, Allstate Insurance, UK\n\nAnthony is the Mainframe Modernization Offering Manager at the Allstate Insurance Company.
