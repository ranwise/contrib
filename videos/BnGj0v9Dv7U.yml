description: "Navigating the Cloud Native Ecosystem for End Users - Cheryl Hung, CNCF \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIf you want to contribute to cloud native but donâ€™t work for a cloud vendor, what should you do? Where do you go? Who do you talk to?    As Director of Ecosystem, Cheryl advocates for end users as they adopt Kubernetes, Prometheus and the cloud native projects. Through 45 interviews conducted in December 2018, she found that end users face three broad challenges:    1. Choosing the right architecture  2. Growing your engineering organization  3. Building your business strategy around cloud native    She will describe how you can overcome these challenges with the help of the CNCF, and the CNCF's strategy for end users in 2019.    Attendees will learn how to participate in and contribute to the cloud native community, and how to be good open source citizens. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrmv"
