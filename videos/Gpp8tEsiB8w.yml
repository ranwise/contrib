Is there a way I can get notifications when they occur?\n20:27 - How do I know if Cluster Verification Utility is enabled and working?\n22:31 - Does Clusterware manage CVU’s operation?\n25:10 - Can I manage or modify the CVU resource?\n27:58 - Which versions of Oracle Grid Infrastructure support CVU?\n28:55 - Does CVU functionality change depending on the versions of the Oracle database are running in my cluster?\n30:30 - How has the CVU functionality changed since it was introduced?\n31:50 - Does this CVU data get uploaded to Oracle Support Services?\n32:56 - You mentioned CVU’s new diagnostic functionality. How does it work?\n35:57 - Which problems does it detect?\n37:50 - How does CVU compare with what ORAchk does?\n39:35 - Should I use both?\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
