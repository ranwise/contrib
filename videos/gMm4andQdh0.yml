Patterns were introduced, copied, pasted, and one day we woke up with queries taking 6s and page load times less than 10s. Customers were complaining. How did we get here?\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss why we chose GraphQL, show practical examples of the mistakes we made in our implementation, and demonstrate how we eliminated all N+1 queries.\n\nI'll answer the question, \"if I knew then what I know now... Would I stick with a REST API?\""
