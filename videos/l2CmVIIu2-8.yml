description: "Edge Lightweight and IoT (ELIOT): To Make Edge Stack Easy to Manage and Scale - Yang (Gabriel) Yu & Khemendra Kumar, Huawei \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightweighted edge is essential for IoT and cloud. It assembles both hardware and software stacks together to reduce the redundancy of the system to the minimum while ensuring that the system behaves as expected by serving millions or billions of services.  To this end, the system needs to be carefully designed and optimized. ELIOT is proposed in Akraino community to deliver open source lightweight edge solution based on Kubernetes, lightweight OS, ARM board, etc. It shows in the first release how to build an MVP lightweight edge stack and how to enable continuous delivery of APP based on it. It is also discussed how this project evolves and to collaborates with upstream edge projects. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrte"
