description: "DOES19 London â€” Here in Infrastructure, we think of ourselves as the Operators for DevOps. But our Application Development colleagues seem to think of us as an impediment. How can a Bank maintain governance, separation of concerns and stability when \"they\" want us to \"hand over the keys\"?\n\nInfrastructure Forecast: Cloudy with a Chance of APIs\n\nDuncan Lawie, Infrastructure Enterprise Architect, Credit Suisse\n\nWith 20+ years in IT and 15+ in the Financial Services Industry, Duncan Lawie was confident of what he was doing and where the world was going. And that DevOps was just another one of those fads that consultants want to whitewash the world with. Now he's trying to understand how to be an explorer all over again.\n\nDOES19 London\nDOES 2019 EUR\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
