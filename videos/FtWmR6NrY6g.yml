description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #23\n5 May 2019\nSponsored and Hosted by Soluto\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nLink to Git: https://github.com/meytala/seenopsis\nThe Why - There is always a need to “feel” the data by exploring the variables. Though essential, this task is sometimes repetitive, time consuming and mainly boring. What if there was a tool that centralizes the main important features of all variables in a dataset, helping to explore the dataset in a structured visualized approach?\nThe What - Seenopsis is designed to help the everyday work of a data scientist, by centralizing the main important features of the different variables in a structured visualized approach.\nThe How - The only required argument in seenopsis is the name of the dataset. Other arguments are optional.\n\nMeytal: Senior epidemiologist and data researcher in Clalit research institute.\nAdjunct Professor at McGill University.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
