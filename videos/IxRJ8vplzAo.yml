description: "I really wanted to cover css animation and transitions today. So I applied it to an input tag that you can use in your html forms.\n\nWe will cover everything from transitions to animations. Pseudo Elements like ::before ::after and :focus selectors.\n\nHope that this will make it easy for you to create css animations and come up with something cool!\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nFollow my Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevEd94\n\nPlease watch: \"Should You Become A Software Engineer?\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_kTl0eIJ4A\n\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-"
