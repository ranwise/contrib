title: 'Building production Flink jobs with Airstream at Airbnb -  Pala Muthiah &  Hao Wang'
recordingDate: 1562602395
description: "Building production Flink jobs with Airstream at Airbnb\n\nAirStream is a realtime stream computation framework that supports Flink as one of its processing engines. It allows engineers and data scientists at Airbnb to easily leverage Flink to build real time data pipelines and feedback loops. Multiple mission critical applications have been built on top of it. In this talk, we will start with an overview of AirStream, and describe how we have designed Airstream to leverage SQL support in Flink to allow users to easily build real time data pipelines. We will go over a few production use cases such as building a user activity profiler and building user identity mapping in realtime. We will also cover how we have integrated Airstream into the data infrastructure ecosystem at Airbnb through easily configurable connectors such as Kafka and Hive that allow users to easily leverage these components in their pipelines.\n\nFlink Forward San Francisco 2019\n#flinkforward"
