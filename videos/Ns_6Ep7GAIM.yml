language: English
recordingDate: 1560802784
description: 'During this April 2019 meetup in San Francisco, Uber research scientist, Piero Molino introduces Ludwig, a deep learning toolbox that lets people without a machine learning background train prediction models without the need to write code. Ludwig is unique in its ability to help make deep learning easier to understand for non-experts and enable faster model improvement iteration cycles for experienced machine learning developers and researchers alike. By using Ludwig, experts and researchers can simplify the prototyping process and streamline data processing so that they can focus on developing deep learning architectures.'
