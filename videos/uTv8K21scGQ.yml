description: "CI builds shouldn't be relegated to an old desktop underneath a developers desk: modern software demands a modern build and release system.\n\nEdward Thomson introduces a cloud-first way of thinking about your builds, taking advantage of containers for simpler, reproducible configuration of build environments, building and testing across more platforms with Docker and QEMU, leveraging GitHub Actions for automation and other strategies to keep your software project's quality high while keeping your costs and overhead low.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
