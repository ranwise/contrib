description: "DOES19 London — The growth of DevOps in large enterprises is driving service organisations to re-think established approaches to technical and customer support.\n\nThis presentation explores the issues being encountered by DevOps teams as their output becomes more significant in enterprises, particularly where they are drawn into traditional support structures which often conflict with the principles of DevOps. We will discuss the ongoing emergence of Swarming as an alternative to 3-tier support structures, showing the latest examples from a diverse range of industries including software, telecommunications, and automotive.\n\nThe presentation will show how Swarming enables smarter interaction between DevOps teams and established ITSM functions, and will show – using the Cynefin framework as an example - how Swarming enables provision of adaptive support for complex distributed systems in a way that tiered support can’t.\n\nHow Swarming Transforms Enterprise Support to Work Better with DevOps\n\nJon Hall, Product Manager, BMC Software\n\nJon is a Principal Product Manager at BMC with nearly two decades of experience in enterprise IT.
