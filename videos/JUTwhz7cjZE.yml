The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAs part of the basic introduction, SIG-OpenStack will provide information on to how to enable the OpenStack cloud provider interface on Kubernetes clusters, as well as how to install a Kubernetes cluster on OpenStack clouds using community-developed tools like Kops and the Cluster-API OpenStack Provider. We will also discuss the SIG work in general, including how to get involved with development, testing, and documentation. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrrQ"
