description: "Hyperledger Fabric Operator: A Faster and Easier Way to Manage a Blockchain Consortium - Haodong Chen, Baidu \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIn practical engineering, it is not easy for users to set up a complete fabric consortium. We migrated fabric resources to Kubernetes. And then we implemented the Fabric Operator to manage phases of each resource type more cloud-native.  In this session, our presentation will answer:  1. How does the Kube Operator work?  2. The plug-in design idea of ​​the Fabric component  3. Why do we use Operator to manage Fabric resources?  4. Operator can manage which Fabric logical objects for us, and what complicated states each logical object has.  5. How do different organizations build a consortium through the Operator? \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrva"
