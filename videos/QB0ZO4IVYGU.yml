description: "Speakers: Sam Bellen (Auth0)\n\nSam Bellen is a Developer Evangelist at Auth0, trying to make authentication and identification as easy as possible, while still keeping it secure.\n\nAfter office hours he likes to play around with the web-audio API, and other “exotic” browser API’s. One of his side projects is a library to add audio effects to an audio input using JavaScript.\n\nWhen not behind a computer, you can find him playing the guitar, having a beer at a concert, or trying to snap the next perfect picture.\n\nKnock knock, who’s there? Authenticating your single page apps using JSON Web Tokens.\n\nWhen it comes to writing code, there’s nothing we take more serious than authentication and security. Modern single page applications bring along new challenges. By using solutions like the OpenID Connect protocol and JSON Web Tokens we can improve the user experience when authenticating with your apps, providing a seamless authentication process.\n\nEvent Page: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
