title: '#HITBHaxpo D1 - Hiding A Secret Distributed Chat System In 802.11 Management Frames - Yago Hansen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1559437952
description: "The talk demonstrates how to deliver a distributed chat system that creates a way for communicating peers by using a covert channel hiding its network traffic in 802.11 management frames ciphered through AES encryption.\n\nTo achieve greater network coverage, each of the nodes participating in the chat acts also as a repeater of the received messages, thus extending the range of operation. The chat also allows sending data files in order to exfiltrate information from high security locations. Thanks to the type of covert communications used, it is very difficult to detect and fight."
