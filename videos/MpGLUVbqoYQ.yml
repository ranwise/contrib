description: "Learn Webpack from Colt Steele in this full tutorial course.  It begins with a simple question: \"What is webpack?\"  Quickly we move on to installing Webpack, configuring it, and adding loaders for CSS, SASS, HTML, and Files.  The course covers cache busting, setting up a dev server, and splitting up your development and production config files. We incorporate multiple Webpack plugins including clean-webpack-plugin, mini-css-extract-plugin,  optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin, terser-webpack-plugin, and html-webpack-plugin.  It's a lot of stuff :) \n\nüíª Code and commits: https://github.com/Colt/webpack-demo-app\n\nüîó Colt Steele's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrqAGUPPMOdo0jfQ6grikZw\nüîó Colt Steele's Udemy courses: https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Course Contents ‚≠êÔ∏è\n‚å®Ô∏è (0:00:00) What Even Is Webpack??\n‚å®Ô∏è (0:08:12) Installing and Running Webpack and Webpack-CLI\n‚å®Ô∏è (0:22:18) Imports, Exports, & Webpack Modules\n‚å®Ô∏è (0:29:58) Configuring Webpack\n‚å®Ô∏è (0:38:57) Loaders, CSS, & SASS\n‚å®Ô∏è (0:53:55) Cache Busting and Plugins\n‚å®Ô∏è (1:07:13) Splitting Dev & Production\n‚å®Ô∏è (1:17:13) Html-loader, File-loader, & Clean-webpack\n‚å®Ô∏è (1:28:17) Multiple Entrypoints & Vendor.js\n‚å®Ô∏è (1:34:45) Extract CSS & Minify HTML/CSS/JS\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
