Powerful API gateways with Ocelot and ASP.Net Core - Dan Patrascu-Baba\nWhen running a microservices / service oriented architecture thinking about the gateway to our services is one of the first things to take into considerations. Building an API gateway is not an easy task since we need to take several topics into considerations like authentication / authorization, load balancing, service aggregation, service discovery rate limiting and so on. Fortunately we don't need to re-invent the wheel since the Ocelot API gateway library is playing well together with ASP.Net Core and allows us to easily configure all the previously mentioned topics."
