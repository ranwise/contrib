language: English
recordingDate: 1557435102
description: 'With nearly every modern application built on open source libraries, developers contributing to these projects rely on CI/CD in order to keep up with the rapid speed of development. CircleCI recently surveyed over 800 open source developers to understand what benefits they have gained by using CI for their open source projects and what challenges they have run into while doing so. Join us as we explore how open source communities are adopting CI/CD to modernize their delivery pipeline and learn some best practices for implementing CI/CD for your own open source projects.'
