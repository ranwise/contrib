description: "Selling Open Source Strategy - Michael Cheng , Facebook \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nWe love open source and for many of us, open source started as a hobby. But somewhere along the way, we've all had to sell its value to someone skeptical. That pitch hasn't always easy. It may not even work in some industries. However, to take open source into future, we will all need it as a critical part of our repertoire. Whether its pitching investors, getting your company to invest in a program office or convincing your manager to make open source part of your job, we could all do a better job of crafting compelling and coherent narratives for how to translate open source into business value. As more and more mainstream companies begin to understand and invest in open source, we'll need the tools and concepts to help capitalize on these opportunities. Drawing from pitches to VCs, investors and board rooms, this talk explores themes and strategies for how to find and improve your voice and personal narrative to make open source an essential part of your growth trajectory. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrtP"
