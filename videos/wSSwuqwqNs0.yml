description: "With the launch of the Reporting API any browser that visits your site can automatically detect and alert you to a whole heap of problems with your application. DNS not resolving? Serving an invalid certificate? Got a redirect loop, using a soon to be deprecated API or any one of countless other problems, they can all be detected and reported with no user action, no agents, no code to deploy. You have one of the most extensive and powerful monitoring platforms in existence at your disposal, millions of browsers. Let's look at how to use them.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at how to configure the browser to send you reports when things go wrong. These are brand new capabilities the likes of which we've haven't seen before and they're already supported in the world's most popular browser, Google Chrome. We'll look at how to receive reports and how to make use of them after having the browser do the hard work.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
