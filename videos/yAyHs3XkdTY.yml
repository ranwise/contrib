description: "Refactoring from Callback Hell to Observables – Live Coding in TS\n\nYou send a request, then you wait for the response. And so it begins… After you get back A, you request B, then C, but only after you also receive D and the user clicks ”OK” in a modal dialog. Sounds familiar? So you know the pain! Asynchronism is probably the most difficult mental leap Single-Page Apps forced us to take, especially if you want to write clean, maintainable code. Join this live-coding session to see us refactoring TypeScript code from callback-hell to promises and then Observables, pair programming and discussing lots of best practices we established for our projects at IBM.\n\nAs we go, we will intentionally avoid any framework-specific intelligence: there will be a minimal Angular7 app, but our focus will remain on paradigms and principles. And at the end, we also prepared a tiny surprise for you: a way to avoid your client/server data structures to ever go out of sync again."
