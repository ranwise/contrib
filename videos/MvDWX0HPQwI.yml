description: 'A common view is that scaling Agile is a change for teams only. Therefore, the focus is primarily on changing development teams, while the system of management, the organisational structure and policies remain the same. At the heart of agile organizations are self-managing teams that solve client needs. This is radically different than the standard way of organizing teams, where teams deliver only a small part of the clientsâ€™ needs. Management faces the task to redesign the organization so that agility at scale becomes possible. Typically this means: Organizing around your product to optimize for solving customer needs. Developing teams that are able to deliver products that meet business objectives and market needs. Moving to a management system that values adaptability and learning over control and predictability. Scaling Scrum requires more than improving at the team level, it requires focus to optimize the whole of product development. From my point of view the question organizations should ask is: How can we change and simplify the organizational design to become really Agile instead of putting Agile famethods on top of the current structures?'
