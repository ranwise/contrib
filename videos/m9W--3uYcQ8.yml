description: "React 16.8 welcomed the dawn of Hooks that are adding missing pieces of functionality to React’s functional components. This March brought a new release from the ReactNative team that introduced hooks to mobile apps also.\nThe class-based API of React has been a problem for some time now. This idea of using functions instead of inheriting from classes plays well with the functional and declarative spirit of React.\nHooks makes it possible to organise logic in components, making them tiny, reusable and let you use state and other React feature without writing a class. You do this by hooking your code into React’s engine.\nIn this talk Alin and Gratian will present the benefits of using the new components in a ReactNative app and what is the current hype all about."
