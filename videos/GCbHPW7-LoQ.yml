description: "DOES19 London — Agile and DevOps practices can cause a mismatch between SDLC (Software Delivery Life Cycle) and ITSM/ITIL practices, putting IT Organizations in jeopardy of becoming the “Department of No!” as they try to maintain compliance and change management in the face of increasing amounts of velocity, new technologies, and complexity coming out of dev organizations.\n \nJoin TOPDesk CIO, Jeroen Boks, as he describes how Software Delivery Management practices transformed their own Service Desk into the “Department of Go” by marrying DevOps and ITSM.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n \n-How a shared data model is the foundation for a single tool chain and ensures rapid feedback for all stakeholders,\n -How a modeled and refactorable pipeline helped them move from 3500 separate product instances to an SOA with a few hundred services, and,\n -How they got their release cycles from 9 months to two weeks and how they plan to get it down to 15 minutes.\n\nThis session presented by CloudBees.\n\nJeroen Boks, CIO, TOPdesk\n\nJeroen is the Chief Information Officer (CIO) at TOPdesk, a SaaS services provider of ITSM solutions designed to “make service management easy.” His experience as Service Management Consultant, and later as Director of Customer Support at TOPdesk, helps him to understand customer needs and has given him a customer-centric approach, while the responsibility of running the TOPdesk SaaS service for over a decade has given him insight into the ever changing field of Operations and Development.\n\nDOES19 London\nDOES 2019 EUR\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
