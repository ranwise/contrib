description: "The domain of Payments, Finance, and more generally FinTech, is a fast-growing industry that reached record global investment of $111.8B in 2018. The underlying technology that powers this incredible growth is also evolving rapidly. Hosted by Uber, MoneyCon 2019 brought together engineers from leading tech companies to present on the latest topics in payments engineering.\n\nIn this talk during MoneyCon 2019, Square's Anthony Bishopric discusses how Square applied a novel cryptographic concept and classic double entry accounting principles to process and disburse hundreds of millions of dollars per day."
