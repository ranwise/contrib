description: "!!Con 2019 - We Love Polyhedra! (And So Should You!) by Nat Alison\n\nFor millennia, mathematicians have marveled at the beauty of polyhedra, the most fundamental of 3D shapes. For years I have admired and researched these figures, and now it is time to me to present my findings. Through the magic of 3D graphical software (oooh), I’ll show you the hidden secrets and relationships of the humble tetrahedron, the stalwart cube, and the rare triangular hebesphenorotunda. We’ll talk about symmetry, beauty, and form as we embark on a mathemagical journey together."
