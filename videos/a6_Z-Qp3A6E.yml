description: "!!Con 2019 - Yes yes ya’ll! Miles of !malloc() and free() styles!¡! by Uche Ogbuji\n\nIt was the early 90s. C++ surging, so you worried C might be fading, just like poetry. Wick-wick-widdack! Hip-Hop was in its golden age, and it would save poetry. Fr-fr-fresh! If freestyle could save verse, why couldn’t it save the malloc() and free()? Microphone check micro-microphone check-ah!\n\nI learned how to program (BASIC then Z80 assembler) while UTFO were battling The Real Roxanne and the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets were still bombing every wall with foul wack juice. I was just getting into University in Nigeria, where we didn’t have the latest, so my nostalgia goes back even further, to FORTRAN 4 and punched cards, boyeeee! back to when James Brown was laying down funk architecture for 90s DJs on MPCs (…rolling in MPVs every week they made 40 Gs!). Hyeeey! I need those hits!\n\nI’ve never stopped programming (how I eat now, yo!), living my deep-nerd Hip-Hop life, reading and writing poetry. Now I’m ‘bout to bring these all together for ya’ll. A nostalgia trip straight off the dome, right there in the Big Apple, the realness, the foundation. Best be dipped in some Karl Kani or FUBU that day! So fresh and so clean-clean!\n\nMorning of the talk I’ll tweet a call: nostalgic programming topics for a freestyle-flavored series of poems. I’ll select a few for the show, ten minutes to flow, taking the rhymes where the crowd wants to go. Might even bite live inspiration from talks preceding mine. Oh yes, I’m ah need some audience participation to keep it hype! Clap your hands everybody! Everybody just clap your hands!"
