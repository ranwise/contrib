description: "** Microservices Architecture Training: https://www.edureka.co/microservices-architecture-training **\nThis session on What is Dependency Injection will give you an introduction to dependency injection and also show a practical implementation of dependency injection with Spring Boot.\nIn this video, you will learn the following:\nWhat is Dependency Injection?\nInversion of Control\nTypes of Dependency Injection\nBenefits of Dependency Injection\nImplement Dependency Injection using Spring Boot\n\n#Edureka #MicroservicesEdureka #DependencyInjectionEdureka #DependencyInjection #SpringBoot \n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN \n \nHow it Works?\n\n1. This is a 4 Week Instructor-led Online Course.\n\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n\n3. At the end of the training, you will be working on a real-time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Microservices Architecture Training\n\nEdureka’s Microservices Architecture training introduces you to the concept of Microservices that are small, lightweight, process-driven components. So, Microservices are the next important thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain applications. This not only makes application development easier but also offers great flexibility and lets you utilize various resources optimally. If you want to build an enterprise-ready implementation of the Microservices architecture, then this course is the first step for you!\n \nIn this Microservices Architecture training, we will start by giving you a deep understanding of the core Microservices concepts and principle with insight in how they have evolved. We will walk you through the complete life cycle - from design to development to testing; including cross-layer concepts such as how to secure Microservices.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat are the Objectives of our Microservices Architecture Training?\n\nAfter completing, Edureka's Microservice training, you will be able to:\n\n1.Understand and differentiate between various Microservices Architectural styles\n2.Apply Microservices Architecture principles\n3.Know how to make the appropriate Microservice Architecture decision\n4.Develop and test a Microservice\n5.Know what technologies can be used to enable Microservices with an example\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy should you go for Microservices Architecture Training?\n\nMicroservices Architecture, or simply Microservices, is a unique method of developing software systems as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. Thanks to its scalability, this architectural method is considered ideal when you have to enable support for a range of platforms and devices spanning across the web, mobile, Internet of Things, and so on. Because of its flexibility, you can also use this method when you’re not sure what kind of devices you’ll need to support in an increasingly Cloud-based future.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are the Pre-Requisites for Microservices Architecture Training ?\n\nThere are no prerequisites for attending this Microservice course. Understanding of programming languages such as Java, basic understanding and familiarity with Spring Boot framework and building  Java applications would be useful to execute Case Study and Project.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho should go for this Microservices Architecture Training?\n\n1.Application Architects\n2.Software Architects\n3.Application Developers\n4.Developer working on Web, Cloud, Mobile, and other social technologies\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll free)."
