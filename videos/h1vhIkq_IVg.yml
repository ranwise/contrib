title: 'Why you should think twice before choosing CosmosDB - Torstein Nicolaysen'
recordingDate: 1562574060
description: "Cosmos DB promises some amazing things, and in all fairness, it’s a pretty cool product. My team has been using Cosmos DB on a system that requires both high levels of performance and uptime. After hours of design sessions, experimentation, performance testing, rewriting the document structure, using new partition keys, faking consistency in the application and several other attempts to make it work for us, we felt that CosmosDB was a bad fit for our use case. The system we work on is in production, and my experience is based on real-world usage.\n\nThis lightning talk will explain some of the issues we faced, what we learned and give some advice on using Cosmos DB. It won’t be all doom and gloom, and you'll even hear some scenarios were Cosmos DB is a perfect match.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
