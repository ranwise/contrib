description: "Ujjwal Sharma\nNode.js\n\nV8 by example: A journey through the compilation pipeline\n\nV8 is complicated. Things change way too fast and it’s really hard to keep track of what’s the fastest way of doing every specific action. But not anymore. Join me, a V8 contributor, on a journey through the compilation pipeline of V8 and understand how it all works under the hood. We’ll take the example of a popular JavaScript builtin method and find that what does and does not trigger de-optimization. By the end of the talk, you will have a fairly decent idea of how builtins are written inside the V8 compilation pipeline, and how to make sure you always take the fast path, no matter what.\n\nhttps://codefest.ru"
