The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nOpenEdge aims to build a general purpose system framework for edge computing which extends cloud application, data and service seamlessly to edge devices.     Leding will share the issues, design concepts, technical architecture and how to develop edge computing applications based on openedge.    The presentation will also introduce how to construct a complete local IoT environment through openedge, collect information from various smart devices, write intelligent policies and control devices, synchronize filtered data to the cloud for visual display, and conduct more in-depth data analysis. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrtq"
