Migrating to Active Storage can be a daunting task on a production application. This talk will explain active storage, why you might want to use it, how it modifies your database, and the benefits and drawbacks of migrating your existing application. Iâ€™ll walk you through my painful journey migrating an existing application. You will leave this talk with a better understanding of the inner workings of active storage and with the confidence to tackle your own migration. This talk is appropriate for all levels of skill and no prior experience or knowledge of active storage is required."
