description: "Speaker: Ben Dechrai\r\n\r\nFrameworks are fantastic. They make your life easier, but it's unlikely you'll just use one. From large organisations with service oriented architectures, to small website redevelopment projects, you won't want to deal with the hassle of migrating and synchronising profiles and identities.
