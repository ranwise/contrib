description: "Service Governance in Production-ready Containerized Cloud Foundry with Istio - Gong Zhang & Xuexiang Cui, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nContainerized Cloud Foundry (CF) turns traditional CF components into micro-services in the Kubernetes (K8s). This approach embraces the benefits that K8s brings and opens up opportunities to manage CF services. Istio provides complete abilities for behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh. In this topic, we will take IBM Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment (CFEE) as an example, to share our experiences about how we adopt Istio into CFEE and utilize Istio to improve operational insights and resolve operation pain points from real world, for example, observing components interactions during application staging, A/B testing and canary upgrade for CF components and failure recovery under workload etc. We've started to contribute this work back to the community of containerized CF solution, hope attendees can experience the fancy features in the short future. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrsR"
