description: "!!Con 2019 - Dance of the Ancestors: I used Neural Networks to Re-imagine African Mask Art !! by Victor Dibia\n\nAfrican mask art are a reflection of culture, beliefs, religion and ancient history from many parts of Africa. In this work, I curate a dataset of 11000 images of African Mask art and train a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) that learns to generate new masks. The modes learned by the GAN (geometry, texture, material) suggest interesting interpretations and conversations that draw attention to the underrepresented area African Art. I also discuss findings on the quality of results, novelty of generated samples, and the impact of data quality on image quality."
