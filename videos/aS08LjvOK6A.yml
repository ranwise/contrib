description: "Usually we DBAs love our jobs. But after three years in one project I realised that a few habits never go away. This presentation is about what the DBA can do to make the daily life in a project bearable. Tuning, data modelling, security, release handling are subjects the developers need help with.\n\nAdmins and developers have seemingly different mindset and frequently conflicts arise. This presentation is based on experience, and is about how we can work better in a development project where an Oracle database is involved.\n\nAs a bonus, a few tips on how to deal with proxies aka project managers will be shared too. For the developers in audience they can think of a presentation with a title “What to do when you hate your DBA”."
