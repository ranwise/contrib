description: "Speaker: Stanley Tan and Grace Chin (Manulife)\n\nStanley is currently the Head of IT Strategy and Transformation at Manulife Singapore. Having spent the past 15 years in IT, he is responsible for setting for the overall strategic tech direction aligned to Manulife’s ambition to become a digital, customer-obsessed leader. In addition to strategy, his other responsibilities include IT architecture, HR, and finance. Apart from these, Stanley’s passion lies with the transformation within the tech teams including driving software engineering excellence and agile ways of working within and beyond IT teams.\n\nManulife Singapore: our journey to make Agile part of our DNA\n\nCome listen to an entertaining, no-BS talk on Manulife’s agile journey in our tech area. Hear about our starting point two years ago, the highs, the lows, and everything in between. We’ll discuss what worked well, what caught us off guard, and what we’re doing to continuously improve as we transition from “doing” agile to “being” agile in our corporate environment. We will also examine the vital importance of visualization, face-to-face communication, and the usage of the Shuhari model to move beyond agile practices.\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
