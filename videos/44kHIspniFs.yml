description: "TiKV Best Practices - James Zhang, PingCAP \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTiKV is an open source distributed transactional key-value database, also a sandbox project of Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Built in Rust and powered by Raft, TiKV provides high availability, strong consistency, ACID compliance, and horizontal scalability.TiKV supports externally-consistent distributed transactions and also implements a coprocessor framework to support distributed computing.  In this talk, we will introduce some best practices of TiKV such as how to control data distribution and what is the recommended deployment in cross-DC scenarios. We will include data balancing topics like scale out and scale in, and how to control the speed of balancing. This talk will also show you how to identify a hotspot issue and how to fight with it. Last but not least, we will introduce how to fine-tune performance under different workloads. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrmC"
