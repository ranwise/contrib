description: "Learn to leverage the power of server-side Javascript with this Node.js introductory tutorial. We’ll dive into Node’s architecture and understand the build and dependency management systems involved. Several modules for Node will be demoed, and we’ll learn how to debug Node applications within an IDE. You’ll come away with an understanding of what sets Node apart from traditional Javascript, it’s inherently asynchronous and event-driven architecture, and take a look at some real world applications built on Node.  \n\nEVENT:\n\nOpen Source Summit 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJustin Reock, Rogue Wave Software \n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsu2QN2ss60"
