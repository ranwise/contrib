description: "Programming paradigms for physical computing and IoT\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Lammermuir]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Ben Nuttall\n\nA look at the GPIO Zero library for Raspberry Pi yields the blueprint for a Pythonic API for programming the behaviour of interconnected devices.\n\nGPIO Zero provides a multi-paradigm programming interface to GPIO devices:\n- procedural (polling)\n- procedural (blocking)\n- event-driven (callbacks)\n- declarative\n\nStart with simple scripts to control LEDs and buttons on a breadboard, learn to prototype ideas and move on to declaring interaction between more advanced devices in the home and beyond.\n\nThese options for device programming, along with the extensibility of the library, provide the means to program complex behaviour using simple Pythonic code.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
