description: "Full Title: Efficient Transfer Learning for Machine Translations @Booking.com\n\nAt Booking.com’s Machine Translation (MT) team, we want to empower people to experience the world without any language barriers. Booking.com is available in 43 languages. But the reviews that our users write used to be available only in the reviewer’s original language of choice. In order for more users to be able to understand and get value from this review, our ultimate goal is to translate also these reviews into all of our 43 languages.\n\nWe will present our workflow of training our MT models with the open source package OpenNMT-tf (multi-GPU training, based on Tensorflow, with Python bindings). We would like to show how using transfer learning with a big dataset of open source translation data (up to 90 million parallel sentences) helped us advance our review translations use case. Increasing our dataset to this scale also introduced the challenge of keeping the training time manageable. We will also dive into more detail on how to monitor GPU-usage, and explain some steps we took to reduce training time.\n\nWe would like to end with a more relaxed and fun demo, in which we'll show:\n\nThe pitfall of training on out-of-domain or narrow data: our original models trained on property descriptions were only able to translate positive text, any negative source was actually translated into positive.\n\nThe power of good and widely trained machine translation models: we will show how doubly translation from English to Spanish and back from Spanish to English can often correct spelling mistakes that were originally made in the English review submitted (!)\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
