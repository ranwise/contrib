description: "Super-Charge Kubernetes App Development Workflow with IDE Extensions - Ian Talarico & Etan Shaul‎, Google \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes is portable, extensible, and powerful - but getting started and configuration management can be painful. Deploying a simple application on Kubernetes involves multiple configuration files and tedious steps. In this session, we'll explore Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDE extensions to simplify the Kubernetes development workflow.  In this session we will: -Create a GKE cluster from the IDE with ease. -Go from nothing to a deployed multi language, multi microservice application in minutes. -Speed up the inner loop using Skaffold to build images and continuously deploy to GKE. -Live debug applications running locally and in a remote cluster from the IDE. -Simplify and reduce needed configuration with Kustomize. -Set up and manage multiple environments. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrli"
