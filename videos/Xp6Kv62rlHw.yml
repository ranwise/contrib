With modern specs and tooling, CSS has never been more straightforward and less reliant on hacks. In this talk, Lemon will show you some common traps people fall in, as well as some general strategies for making a layout grid you can proud to build and confident in releasing.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
