description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nOne of the main characteristics of the good streaming pipeline is correctness for event time processing. Real challenges become when such pipeline should be resilient to different types of failures. In this talk, we describe how Criteo runs Flink on one of the biggest Yarn clusters in Europe and computes 100k messages per second to acknowledge revenue of our platform within the delay of 5 minutes.
