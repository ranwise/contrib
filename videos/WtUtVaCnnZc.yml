description: "Synopsis: GOJEK, the Southeast Asian super app, has experienced a massive increase in customer growth by leveraging machine learning throughout its products. However, building production grade machine learning systems is still fraught with challenges and delays. In order to address these challenges GOJEK has adopted Kubeflow, a fully open source cloud native platform for machine learning.\r\nIn this talk you will learn how Kubernetes and Kubeflow empowers teams at GOJEK by increasing the speed at which they turn ideas into products. We will show how Kubeflow, which leverages Kubernetes and Istio, simplifies the process of rapidly training, deploying, and evaluating models.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Willem Pienaar leads the data science platform team at GOJEK, working on the GOJEK ML platform, which supports a wide variety of models and handles hundreds of million of orders every month. His main focus areas are building data and ML platforms, allowing organizations to scale machine learning and drive decision making.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/GCPUGSG/events/258359490/\r\n\r\nRecorded By: Allan A.
