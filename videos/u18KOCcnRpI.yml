description: "!!Con 2019 - Go For Phallic Object Generation! by Ellen Körbes\n\nInstalling a vagina makes the body go all “oh noes theres a huge gash here I better close it asap!!” To avoid that happening, there are dilators. They’re used on the vaginal canal to, well, y’know, dilate it. And human bodies are very efficient—not dilating for even a single day may prove catastrophic.\n\nDilators are phallic, like a dildo, but they’re not sex toys—they’re medical devices. Not that it matters, depending on what kind of airport security you run into. If I take my dilators as carry-on, they might get confiscated; if I dispatch them, the bags might get lost. Given that I can’t miss a single day… it’s scary.\n\nThe solution is 3D-printable dilators. This way if something happens, just run to a hackerspace and print a new one. In this talk we’ll see how to generate and render 3D objects with nothing but Go, in a way that’s suitable for 3D printing."
