description: "Strongly consistent databases are dominating world of software. However, with increasing scale and global availability of our services, many developers often prefer to loose their constraints in favor of an eventual consistency.\n\nDuring this presentation we'll talk about Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDT) - an eventually-consistent structures, that can be found in many modern day multi-master, geo-distributed databases such as CosmosDB, DynamoDB, Riak, Cassandra or Redis: how do they work and what makes them so interesting choice in highly available systems.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
