description: "What does shape the current state of Web Design? How can we leverage CSS to support the art movement on the Web?\nLetâ€™s dive into art direction and trends to find a new way to express our design ideas in CSS. During my talk you will find more about the intersection of CSS code with collages techniques, anti-design aesthetics and much more. Everything will be combined with practical CSS and many examples you can use on your websites right away. I will be presenting some of my CSS experiments to show you that art has a true impact on CSS properties and new features.\nFind your inner designer and join me on this artistic CSS journey.\n\nAgnieszka is a coding designer with a strong focus on UX-related issues, currently working at Adobe in Warsaw, Poland.\nShe is the co-founder of The Awwwesomes an initiative teaching how to create awwwesome things on the Web, organizing coding & UX workshops for beginners, co-organizing conferences (Front Trends 2018 and Element UX Talks) and meetups in Poland.
