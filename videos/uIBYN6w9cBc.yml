description: "Performance advocates spend a lot of time telling developers how to build fast and reliable experiences on the web. Every website is built differently, however.\n\nInstead of just listing a number of progressive enhancements and techniques, this talk will try to take a different approach. We’ll first explore who needs to consider improving their site in the first place and see if their is a messaging problem between advocates and developers in the community. We’ll then address concerns that can arise when performance is being worked on and discuss some real and practical solutions.\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/houssein-djirdeh/performance-empathy.html"
