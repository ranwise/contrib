description: "With the release of DOOM and DOOM II, id software were masters of mayhem, riding high and unstoppable. They would soon begin work on Quake, an ambitious truly 3D FPS that would seek, once again, to redefine the state of the art. Released in 1996, Quake introduced the world to 3D mouse look, 60fps 3D texture-mapped rendering with lighting, and internet multiplayer with a client/server architecture. With its release came the birth of eSports as clans and competitions sprung up worldwide. Over twenty years later, it is still acknowledged as one of gaming’s masterworks. In this talk, id co-founder and Quake designer John Romero takes the audience through the rollercoaster that was Quake’s creation and reveals why it brought about the end of the Original id.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
