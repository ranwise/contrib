title: 'The Seven Deadly Presentation Sins - Samantha Cotes and Andrew Coates'
recordingDate: 1561711103
description: "What makes a great presentation? More importantly, what are the elements that can destroy a great presentation, even if the content itself is technically sound?\n\nIn this session Samantha and Andrew Coates demonstrate seven sins that must not be committed in a presentation, why and how a presentation can suffer from committing them, and how to avoid accidently committing them. \n\nIronically, when we practice we deliberately commit presentation sins. We stop, we fix, we repeat and refine. Like elite musicians, dedicated technical presenters typically spend many solitary hours doing this, which of course is necessary to master any content. But none of these practice processes has a place on the presentation stage. In presentation we must trust, believe, create, and keep going in the face of any adversity â€“ a completely different process which in itself must be rehearsed. \nIn order to give a magnificent presentation, we must PRACTICE giving a magnificent presentation. The only way to do this is by regularly and deliberately creating pressure situations in which we can practice NOT committing the presentation sins.\n\nCovering everything from wrong notes to blue screens of death, this dynamic and multi-talented pair not only break down the elements of successful and unsuccessful presentations, but also outline how one can give a truly engaging presentation every time, no matter how basic or complex the content.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
