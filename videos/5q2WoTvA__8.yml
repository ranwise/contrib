description: "Intro: Falco - Kaizhe Huang, Sysdig \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFalco is a CNCF Sandbox project focused on Container Runtime Security. In this maintainers track session we will focus on what runtime security is and how it differs from other layers of security for Kubernetes. We will show how to enable system call abnormality detection using Falcoâ€™s eBPF integration, as well as how to detect abnormal behavior in the Kubernetes API server. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of Falco and runtime security, how to get started writing their own Falco rules, and how to contribute improvements to the project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrrf"
