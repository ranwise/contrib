description: "DOES19 London â€” In a year long collaboration with Gene Kim and Dr. Stephen Magill, we objectively examined and empirically documented software release patterns and cybersecurity hygiene practices across 54,000 commercial development teams and open source projects.\n \nIn this session, we will present evidence on the outcomes of that research, highlighting organizational and technology practices that enable exemplar open source teams to deliver 50% more commits, release new code 2.4x faster, and remediate security vulnerabilities 2.9x faster, all while delivering a level of value that makes them standouts in terms of popularity and adoption.\n\nExemplars, Laggards, and Hoarders: A Data-driven Look at Open Source Software Supply Chains\n\nStephen Magill, Principal Scientist, Galois, Inc.\nDerek Weeks, Vice President, Sonatype\n\nStephen Magill is a Principal Scientist at Galois, Inc. and a world-recognized expert on programming languages and program analysis, with work ranging from development of high-level languages to static analysis of low-level systems code.
