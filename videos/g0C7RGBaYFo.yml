But the DevOps journey at scale is full of technical, organizational en operational hurdles. Lessons to be shared and learned from.\n\nIn becoming a more responsive organization to customer needs, the focus is on becoming Better, Faster, Cheaper and Happier. Experimenting, Metrics, Tools, MVPs, Continuous Learning, Team Performance and Impediment Management are some of the ingredients used to make DevOps work and overcome the organizational silos.\n\nDutch Railways Scaled DevOps Journey\n\nArd Westerik, Head of Software Development, Dutch Railways\n\nThe latest ten years of his professional career, Ard got heavily involved in agility topics, starting out as General Manager at an IT incubator company supporting start-ups.
