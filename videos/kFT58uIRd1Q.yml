description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nIdentifying the number of hidden units in a fully connected layer is considered a heuristically-guided craft. A PyTorch library, Delve, was developed that allows identifying the degree of over-parameterization of a layer, thus guiding architecture selection. The library compares the intrinsic dimensionality of the layer over training, providing the user with live feedback during training.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
