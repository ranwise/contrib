description: "DOES19 London — Every day, ITIVITI executes the orders of 29,000+ institutional clients on their popular securities trading platform, supporting 3,600+ physical connections and more than 38M messages daily. In 2015, the company embarked on a mission to transform their completely manual, unscalable deployment process into a fully automated deployment pipeline that is kicked off by users and driven by Slack. Given the high stakes, deployment failures simply could not be tolerated. And with more than 2,000 deployments a month, speed and efficiency were crucial too.\n\nFrom people challenges to technology choices to build vs. buy decisions, this talk will describe ITIVITI’s DevOps journey: what happened, why it happened, how it succeeded, lessons learned, and what challenges remain. Come learn how one innovative enterprise streamlined software delivery while reducing risk, and how you can too.\n\nThis session presented by XebiaLabs.\n\nWhen Failure Is Not an Option: From Fully Manual to Slack-based Deployments at ITIVITI\n\nAntoine Moreau, SVP - Head of Infrastructure Services, ITIVITI\nLisa Wells, Vice President of Marketing, XebiaLabs\n\nAntoine started his career in the financial industry more than 12 years ago, working in trading rooms where he was involved in many different functions, such as commando development, functional support, and management.
