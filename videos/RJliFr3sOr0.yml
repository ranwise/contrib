description: "The New Open \"Edge\" - Tina Tsou, Arm \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21 and in Amsterdam March 30 – April 2, 2020! Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWith the emergence of new technologies such as 5G, AR/VR, autonomous cars, and IoT, data is being produced at the user end of the network. These use cases demand real-time processing and communication between distributed endpoints, creating the need for efficient processing at the network edge using “Edge Computing”.    The Akraino Edge Stack is a LF Edge project that addresses the technology gaps and creating open source software for edge.    Akraino Edge Stack “blueprints” delivers end to end solution for a particular Edge use case, which is complete, tested, production deployable. Akraino Integrates multiple Opensource together to deliver the blueprints.    In this talk, we will share:   1. Edge Use Cases for Akraino and its blueprints, especially for containerized networking.  2. Varieties of Blueprints Akraino Community is developing.  3. How to engage and contribute to the Akraino Community \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrsX"
