We'll dissect scalability and reliability problems of a traditional thread-based stacks and discuss the process of mitigating those issues by introducing asynchrony with Kotlin coroutines. We'll see how coroutine-based design naturally avoids common pitfalls of traditional asynchronous programming such as resource management, error handling and request cancellation, producing safe [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/827\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#kotlin #programming #ProgrammingLanguages"
