title: 'YOW! Data 2019 - Brendan Hosking - Custom Continuous Deployment to Uncover the Secrets in the Genome'
recordingDate: 1562187600
description: "Reading the genome to search for the cause of a disease has improved the lives of many children enrolled in clinical trials. However, to convert research into clinical practice requires the ability to query large volumes of data and find the needle in the haystack efficiently. This is hampered by traditional server- and database-based approaches being too expensive and unable to scale with accumulating medical information.\n\nWe hence developed a serverless approach to exchange human genomic information between organisations. The framework was architected to provide instantaneous analysis of non-local data on demand, with zero downtime costs and minimal running costs.\n\nWe used Terraform to write the infrastructure, enabling rapid iteration and version control at the architecture level. In order to maintain governance over our infrastructure created in this way, we developed a custom Continuous Deployment service that built and securely maintained each project, providing visibility and security over the entire organisationâ€™s cloud infrastructure.\n\nServerless ambassador creating solutions for genetic analysis and engineering problems that that run quickly, scale instantly, have minimal running costs and zero idle costs.\n\nFor more on YOW!
