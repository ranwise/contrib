This Machine Learning using Python Training exposes you to concepts of Statistics, Time Series and different classes of machine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms. Throughout the Data Science Certification Course, you’ll be solving real-life case studies on Media, Healthcare, Social Media, Aviation, HR.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy Learn Machine Learning?\n\nData Science is a set of techniques that enables the computers to learn the desired behavior from data without explicitly being programmed. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. This course exposes you to different classes of machine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms. This course imparts you the necessary skills like data pre-processing, dimensional reduction, model evaluation and also exposes you to different machine learning algorithms like regression, clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes and Q-Learning.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdureka’s Python Machine Learning Certification Course is a good fit for the below professionals:\nDevelopers aspiring to be a ‘Machine Learning Engineer'\nAnalytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts\nBusiness Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques\nInformation Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics\n'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrerequisite: The pre-requisites for the Machine Learning Certification Training using Python includes development experience with Python. Fundamentals of Data Analysis practiced over any of the data analysis tools like SAS/R will be a plus. However, Python would be more advantageous. You will be provided with complimentary “Python Statistics for Data Science Course” as a self-paced course once you enroll for the course.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGot a question on the topic?
