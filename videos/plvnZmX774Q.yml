We devise all kinds of strategies for avoiding or placating them, even at the expense of others' happiness.\n\nWhat if it didn't have to be that way?\n\nThis talk approaches jerks as the mutable objects all people are. If you think you might be a jerk, or if you're looking for a new approach to the jerks in your life, this talk is for you! We'll cover what makes a jerk and what the positive alternative looks like. You'll leave with a set of practical ways to defuse negative urges, hold yourself accountable, and transform your behavior in a variety of situations, such as meetings, disagreements, or when things go wrong."
