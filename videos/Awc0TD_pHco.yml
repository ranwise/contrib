description: 'In the last year there were several advances in practical quantum computing: now there are free quantum chips available on the cloud for everyone, and the largest quantum chips exceeds 50 qubits, a number called “the quantum supremacy” because theoretically a quantum chip exceeds the power of a classical computer. We’ll explain how to program a quantum chips and give the results of our research regarding reversing some cryptographic building blocks like P-Box, S-Box, CRC-8 and XOR functions using quantum circuits. We’ll see the implementations and run some circuits on real hardware to understand how near we are from attacking real cryptography.'
