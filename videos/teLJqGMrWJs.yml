description: "!!Con 2019 - I built a robot to cheat at Pokemon!! by Sophie Deziel\n\nA bunch of servomotors and a webcam is all you need to let a computer play some video games right? Turns out you have to work hard to be lazy. That’s what I’ve learned putting the pieces together to automate exchanging fossils in hope of getting a shiny Omanyte in Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu. In this talk, I’ll show you what pieces of Open-Source software I use to control almost any hardware from a web browser.\n\nSophie works as a web developer in Montreal. She is also a streamer on Twitch, creating french content about electronics and programming."
