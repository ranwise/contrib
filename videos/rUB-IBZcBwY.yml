description: "Networking the Service Mesh Proxy: Where We Are, Where We’re Going - Tim Swanson & John Joyce, Cisco \n\nRedirecting application traffic to/from a proxy and lifecycle management of proxy instances are common requirements for service mesh implementations. The traffic and lifecycle problems are, to a large extent, tied. Many ideas for flexibility and optimization are emerging from multiple communities. This talk will discuss the current approaches for networking application service instances with sidecar proxies including lifecycle management. It will cover those implemented by Istio & Linkerd (including the Istio CNI plugin) as well as other open projects solving the same or similar patterns. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPes"
