description: "Abstract:\n“GraphQL” and “Serverless” generate a lot of industry buzz separately. Combining slick serverless paradigms with the statically-typed goodness of GraphQL may just break the internet...but that’s what we’re going to do. Together, we’ll briefly cover what “serverless” means and how GraphQL works. Then, we’ll construct a simple GraphQL API from scratch using open-source tools and deploy the API to multiple serverless environments. Finally, we’ll discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of deploying a GraphQL API in a serverless fashion."
