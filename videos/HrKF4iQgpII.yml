description: "What is the ultimate goal of building technology? If anything you build touches people, you are in the experience economy. You build relations and touch feelings – And… you do it for the future, soon for a superhuman future. So what do you want us to feel?\n\nMartin talks about the mechanics and dynamics of change. How fast is it? What it means to be an innovator and strategist is transforming faster than before, from classic product definition and styling of the superficial to systemic connections of everything, including social and political systems, deeply rooted in a space of challenges and promises between cutting edge tech and humanism. In an exponential and converging digital-fueled change, we build a relationship, a behavior, that the product will follow. This change is our most important innovation brief and the stakes are high. Technology is the human evolution, it creates a playground that Martin calls the “Humachine\", a symbiosis between human ingenuity and machine intelligence, this opens new horizons for our imagination in a time when “now” has never been so temporary. But one thing will not change for some time… we want to feel and you are accountable to make technology that listens, understands that works amazingly and makes us feel great.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
