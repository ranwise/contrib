description: "Speaker: Charles Guinot\n\nCharles Guinot is the Founder and CEO of OnlinePajak, a web-based application that allows its users to prepare, pay and file their taxes in one simple integrated online platform. The robotics engineer, who received his master’s degree from the Université de Technologie de Compiègne in France, never dreamed that he would achieve what he did in 2017 with OnlinePajak reaching IDR 40 trillion in tax-managed. OnlinePajak aims to help the business community in Indonesia from individual taxpayers, small medium business, until large enterprise nation-wide, which is being the official partner of Indonesia’s Directorate General of Taxes.\n\nHypergrowth for social impact\n\nOnlinePajak is at heart a social enterprise in the skin of a startup. Few people pay taxes in Indonesia. Without a budget for the government, you have no roads, no school, no hospital. Our mission is to double the state revenue of the country.\n\nIt’s not a small task: we are talking about bringing 210M people and 15M companies into compliance. Time is not on our side as Indonesia is facing a development trap. By the time the country develops AI, robotics and great disruptions will have occurred.\n\nTo deliver we need to turn on the “overdrive”, a state of exponential growth where fundamentals of a company are put to test.\n\nHow to build a company culture with new people every month? How to keep your mission and your soul when you bring in new investors every year? How to balance social impact with revenue and profits?\n\n\nEvent Website: https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/"
