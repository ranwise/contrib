description: "From Relay to Apollo, a story of GraphQL clients\n\nGraphQL is becoming the norm for defining an application’s API, however, taking full advantage of it requires a deep knowledge of the popular GraphQL clients out there. Having used both Relay and Apollo in a production environment that serves millions of users, Mihai has a few tips and tricks to share.\n\nIn this talk he will provide a comparative view of the most popular JavaScript GraphQL clients (i.e. Relay and Apollo), focusing on their API, their biggest selling point, and how they are used in the wild. Additionally he will share the story behind the move from Relay to Apollo at Hudl, focusing on the motivation and lessons learned from this decision."
