title: 'Introducing a Lightweight Kubernetes Distribution Built for the Edge'
language: English
recordingDate: 1551220865
description: "Kubernetes is pushing out of the data center into stores, networks and factories. DevOps teams are excited about Kubernetes because it provides predictable operations and a cloud-like provisioning experience on just about any infrastructure. For the last year we’ve been working with organizations looking for a lightweight implementation of Kubernetes that is easy to operate and can run on x86 and ARM infrastructure without using more than 512 MB of memory.  To meet these requirements we’ve developed a new distribution of Kubernetes that is designed for teams that need to deploy applications quickly and reliably to resource-constrained environments.\n\nIn this webinar Rancher co-founders Shannon Williams and Darren Shepherd will discuss:\n\n- The specific requirements for running Kubernetes on the edge.\n- Developing an operational model for single-node and clustered edge environments\n- Which  parts of the Kubernetes code base we were able to remove\n- Why we introduced SQLlite as an alternative to etcd\n- Developing support for x86, arm64 and armhf\n- Management options for hundreds of micro clusters"
