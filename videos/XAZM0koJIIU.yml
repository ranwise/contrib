description: "Dungeons & Dragons, or D&D, is the grand-daddy of all role playing games. While playing D&D is great fun, the rules are a bit daunting for the beginner. The basic rulebook, the PHB, clocks in at a solid 300 pages, and can be extended with multiple additional rule sets. This should come as no surprise to software engineers: this is, after all, documentation for a system that models a complex domain, and has been in use for over 40 years now, going through numerous redesigns over time.\n\nAs such, D&D rules make for a great exercise in domain modelling. In this talk, I will take you along my journey attempting to tame that monster. We will use no magic, but a weapon imbued with great power, F#; practical tips and tricks for the Adventurer on the functional road will be shared. So... roll 20 for initiative, and join us for an epic adventure in domain modeling with F#!\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
