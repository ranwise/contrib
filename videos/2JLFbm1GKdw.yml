recordingDate: 1560816340
description: "Abstract:\nRunning Twitter services on Graal has been very successful and saved Twitter a lot of money on datacenter cost. But we would like to run more efficiently to reduce the cost even more. I mean, who doesnâ€™t? In order to do this, we are using our Machine Learning framework called Autotune to tune Graal inlining parameters. This talk will show how much performance improvement we got by autotuning Graal."
