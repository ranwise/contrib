title: 'Dino Esposito - Component-based C# and Razor Programming in Blazor'
language: English
recordingDate: 1562145030
description: 'Blazor is a WebAssembly-based framework for building client-side applications using C# and Razor. Like most SPA frameworks Blazor promotes a massive use of independent HTML-based components. In Blazor you write such components using the Razor markup language, C# code snippets and whatever CSS library you wish, including Bootstrap 4 or Material Design. More than everything else, though, in Blazor you can count on the tag helpers support of ASP.NET Core Razor. In the session, youâ€™ll see how to create highly reusable and configurable components that just look like plain markup elements with the syntax and behavior you code. And no JavaScript whatsoever. (Or at least no JavaScript is strictly required.)'
