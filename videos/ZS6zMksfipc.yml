description: "High Available + Scalable Prometheus with Thanos in Alibaba - Guo'an Qin, Alibaba & Tao Li, Alibaba \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAlibaba Group is using Kubernetes to support the world's largest e-commerce business. With the respect of the availability and scalability, how to provide reliable fine-grained monitoring and alerting services is a indeed challenge.    In this talk, we'll share the experiences in developing a fine-grained monitoring system with high availability and scalability based on the open source project Prometheus and Thanos. This system mainly supports Alibaba's cluster management system, which has 4 million TPS and 10K requests per-second.    We will have a discussion in following topics. 1) How to support a large-scale scenarios using Prometheus? 2) How to solve data query problem caused by multiple Prometheus instance with low query latency using Thanos? 3) The lessons we learnt from Prometheus and Thanos's configuration, such as target discovery and management of recording rule and alerting rule. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NroK"
