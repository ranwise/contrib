description: "RailsConf 2019 - Congressive Management Techniques: Gardening Your Team by Jennifer Tu & Zee Spencer\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nCloud 66 - Pain Free Rails Deployments\nCloud 66 for Rails acts like your in-house DevOps team to build, deploy and maintain your Rails applications on any cloud or server.\n\nGet $100 Cloud 66 Free Credits with the code: RailsConf-19\n($100 Cloud 66 Free Credits, for the new user only, valid till 31st December 2019)\n\nLink to the website: https://cloud66.com/rails?utm_source=-&utm_medium=-&utm_campaign=RailsConf19\nLink to sign up: https://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_in?utm_source=-&utm_medium=-&utm_campaign=RailsConf19\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nUgh. Management. Agile was supposed to free us from that, right? Self-organized, cross-functional teams who get stuff done without that old-guard hierarchy. In this fauxtopia, some developers were more equal than others. Can we get the healthy parts back without the Lumberghs?\n\nTo bring back healthy engineering management we first must de-mystify and de-stigmatize the concept of management. In this talk we will: * Explore the context of management * Learn the responsibilities of management * Discuss the techniques of management\n\nAs a developer, you'll be equipped to understand, empathize with, and influence your boss. As a manager, you'll build a foundation to help you better serve your team."
