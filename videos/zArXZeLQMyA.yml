title: 'The security issue that killed a financial product launch | Nicola Sedgwick | CukenFest London 2019'

description: "This talk took place at CukenFest London 2019, our annual conference for BDD enthusiasts. More info here - http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nSecurity issues can be identified using the stock-and-trade critical thinking skills of a tester.\n\nSome time ago I had the pleasure of taking part in a security bug hunt for a new financial product. This was a product ready to go to market, a product that had passed all penetration tests and was now being handed to a crowd of external testers for a final attempt to 'hack' the product.\n\nAgainst all their confidence I was able to 'hack' that product and use funds to which I should not have had access. However, once I reported the vulnerability, I wasn't believed and I was asked to repeat the 'hack' multiple times until the 'experts' believed I was achieving what I was reporting - they simply couldn't believe that their penetration test result was wrong.\n\nLike many security talks I will tell you all about the tool I used to perform this 'hack'; Unlike many security talks this is not a tool you can install, rent or purchase - because it's my brain, but your brain is capable of doing the same.\n\nNicola Sedgwick (@nicolasedgwick)"
