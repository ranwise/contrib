title: 'Oleg Šelajev - GraalVM: Run Programs Faster Anywhere'
language: English
recordingDate: 1561450633
description: "GraalVM is a high-performance embeddable polyglot virtual machine for dynamic, static, and native languages. GraalVM supports Java, Scala, Kotlin, and other JVM-based languages, also JavaScript including node.js, Ruby, R, and Python. See demos of what GraalVM can do and how to start using it.\n\nGraalVM project enhances the Java ecosystem with an integrated, polyglot, high-performance execution environment for dynamic, static, and native languages. GraalVM supports Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages. At the same time, it can run the dynamic scripting languages JavaScript including node.js, Ruby, R, and Python.\n\nIn this session you’ll see demos and learn what you can do with GraalVM, from using it as the JVM JIT compiler, enhancing the JIT, running native and polyglot programs, compiling them ahead of time for faster startup and lower runtime overhead, debugging your polyglot code using exact same tools for any language, to profiling performance and memory of your application and embedding GraalVM in a native application for portability.\n\nGraalVM offers you the opportunity to write the code in the language you want, which suits the problem the best, and run the resulting program really fast wherever you like: JVM, native code, even inside a database."
