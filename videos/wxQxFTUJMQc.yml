description: "They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but it’s not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance.” (T. Pratchett) \n\nThis talk is not going to be related only to Oracle. It won’t be related only to any database in fact. Most examples will be shown in Python, but since they originate from analyzing Assembler code, you will see that they are going to be pretty much universal. Just open your mind to the old."
