title: 'Flink as a Library (and still as a Framework) - Gary Yao'

description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nContainerized deployments have taken the world by storm. Containers make your application portable across different machines and operating systems. They allow to scale applications in a matter of seconds. And they significantly simplify and speed up deployments which decreases development and operating costs. Consequently, more and more users want to deploy Apache Flink in containerized environments.\nIn order to make Flink ready for container deployments, the Flink community has completely reworked Flink’s distributed architecture and added RESTful client-server communication. Moreover, the community added a container entry point with which it is a child’s play to build container images to get started.\n\nIn this talk, we will take a closer look at the improvements to Flink which make it a first class citizen of the container world. We will demonstrate how easy it is to set up a Flink cluster on Kubernetes and discuss common pitfalls. We will conclude the talk with an outlook on future developments such as native Kubernetes support.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
