description: "Keynote: Kubernetes: Lessons from the Trenches – Arun Gupta, Principal Open Source Technologist, Amazon Web Services \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAWS launched Amazon EKS over a year ago, and it is now one of the fastest growing compute service in the AWS cloud. We will share the lessons learned running thousands of production clusters on behalf of our biggest accounts. We will talk about how we support enterprise scale clusters without compromising blast-radius, MTTR and MTBF, and testability. We have security practices, networking models, and permissions integrations that didn't exist a year ago. Building native -interfaces for tasks like log data analysis, in-place version upgrades, and cluster provisioning were large efforts requiring the technologists throughout the AWS team to gain expertise in Kubernetes. The attendees would learn about The Good, The Bad and The Ugly parts of building and managing Kubernetes clusters at scale at AWS. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nxxf"
