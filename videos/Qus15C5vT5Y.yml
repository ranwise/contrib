In this session, we will be exploring how Chaos Engineering can help us learn and improve our production system by experimenting against it from various angles. We will be using the Open Source Chaos Toolkit CLI to initially codify our experiments before using the Chaos Platform to schedule them and collaborate on our learnings. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPlV"
