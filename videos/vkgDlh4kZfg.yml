description: "Reuse your web skills to build native apps with nativescript and angular or vue.js - Are you a web developer who always wanted to write an app for both iOS and Android, but want to write it only once? Do you want a true, performant, native app, but don’t want to learn yet another language, yet another framework and get used to yet another IDE?\n\nWith NativeScript, this is easier than you might think! NativeScript is an open source framework that lets you build truly native apps from one code base using Angular, Vue.js, TypeScript or JavaScript. You will get 100% access to all native APIs directly from your JavaScript or TypeScript code.\n\nIn this session Peter Eijgermans will introduce NativeScript and show how easy it is to reuse your Angular en Vue skills to build awesome native apps. Peter also answer the question when to choose for PWA’s or JavaScript-driven native app frameworks like NativeScript And finally the attendees will build an App in Vue.js within 5 minutes with NativeScript Playground."
