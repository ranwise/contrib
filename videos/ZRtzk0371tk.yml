recordingDate: 1559819326
description: 'Flexbox, Grid and Box Alignment are the cornerstones of modern CSS layouts. They introduce behaviours that might seem confusing if you donâ€™t completely understand how the browser inteprets the CSS values you assign, e.g. sizing with Flexbox, or the various options for sizing tracks in Grid. This talk will explain a variety of modern CSS layout techniques through live demonstrations via DevTools, and provide real-world use cases of how such techniques allow designs to better adapt across a broad range of viewports.'
