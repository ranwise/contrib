description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\nScalability and resilience are key goals for modern applications. To achieve this, applications can run on the reactive stack provided in Spring Boot 2. Many applications already made the transition and are experiencing the benefits.\n\nIn this session, we will explore what are those benefits. We will use various benchmarks to understand how key application metrics are impacted and what it means in our cloud native world. Several use cases will be shown to help driving the decision for a reactive design transformation that fits your architecture goals."
