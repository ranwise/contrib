description: "As the the data space has increased, data engineering has emerged as a separate and related role that works together with data scientists. Usually data scientists focus on finding new insights from a data set, while data engineers are concerned with the production readiness of that data.\n\nIn this talk I’ll show you how to gather and collect the huge amount of data, stores it, does batch processing or real-time processing on it, and how to build data pipeline using Airflow for processing billion of records per table.\n\nAlso we will discuss what is big data, and why it’s important to be able to process it so quick."
