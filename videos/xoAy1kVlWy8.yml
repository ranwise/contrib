description: "(k)Native K8s CI/CD platform - Shash Reddy, Pivotal \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\nIn this talk we will discuss how to use the Knative Pipeline project to configure and run CI/CD pipelines for your Kubernetes applications. Youâ€™ll be able to manage and observe CI/CD objects with kubectl the same way that you would interact with Kubernetes resources. We will dive into the major features Knative Pipeline supports and how to use them. This talk will include  - How to build pipelines.  - How to run one-off tasks.  - How to leverage the K8s ecosystem while running Pipelines for diagnosis and observability.  - Demonstrate a couple of use cases like an application developer pushing source code  building images  deploying application on their cluster without any external CI/CD resource.    This talk proposal is also submitted to Kubecon Europe 2019. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrmR"
