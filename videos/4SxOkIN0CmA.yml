description: "RestoreGAN: Applying Feature Pyramid Networks to Image Restoration, Orest Kupyn\nImage Restoration task includes a wide variety of different cases (Super Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Dehazing, etc.) Still almost all of the SOTA approaches use simple architectures that were originally designed for Style Transfer. I will show how to apply Feature Pyramid Networks to this problem and present DelburGAN-V2 - new architecture with Superior Quality, Efficiency, and Flexibility"
