description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nIn my role as a VP of Engineering at a fast-growing startup, I spent hundreds of hours interviewing and sourcing candidates in the last year alone. The bar we set ourselves was high: not just hire people with excellent skills and culture add, but also maintain and improve our current diversity (33% women, 9% people of color) across experience levels.\n\nThe result of that is an inclusive and effective hiring process that lets us successfully grow the team while providing a great candidate experience. Even candidates who reject our offers end up recommend us to their friends! This talk will take you through a step-by-step hands-on guide on improving your skills as an interviewer and setting up a better hiring process at your company - no matter how large or tiny.\n\nLearn about:\n\n- Creating inclusive performance profiles to replace your traditional job requirements\n- Conducting phone screens with potential candidates that make them excited to invest their time in the hiring process\n- Creating a blind coding test screening process optimised for consistency and gives you useful information\n- Setting up an interview process that leaves your candidate excited to work with you, while empowering your team to become better interviewers\n- Interview techniques that let you gather information that provides actual evidence on the candidate's past performance\n\nAbout Ola Sitarska\nOla Sitarska is VP of Engineering at Verve where she empowers teams to create high performing, diverse and compassionate environment. Before joining Verve, Ola co-founded Django Girls, a global non-profit teaching basics of web development to 17000 women in 4 years."
