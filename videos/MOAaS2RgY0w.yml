description: "Preventing DMA Attacks from Thunderbolt Devices - Lu Baolu, Intel \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThunderbolt, shipped on MacOS and Windows platforms, allows the connection of external peripherals directly through the PCIe bus to a computer. Although silicon vendors have DMA remapping technologies to prevent DMA attacks, systems are still vulnerable to DMA attacks from malicious peripherals connected through the thunderbolt ports. This session will present the security issues we have identified with Linux, and solutions we have developed. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NruQ"
