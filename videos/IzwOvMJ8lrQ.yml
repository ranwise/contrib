description: "Spring I/O 2019 - Barcelona, 16-17 May\n\nIn this session, we are going to talk about developing your own server using pure Non-Blocking Java API. First of all, we will start with the reason why non-blocking is important in the development of modern web applications. Smoothly moving from that point, we will cover the central challenges of building non-blocking servers. In turn, we will introduce the Reactive Programming technique for simplification our code and be turning everyday software development into the art. Since Java Non-Blocking API is nothing more than actionsâ€™ execution and reacting to asynchronous responses, we will see how simple become development of complicated things with the usage of Reactive Programming with Project Reactor."
