title: 'Writing reusable UI components - Yakir Narkis'
recordingDate: 1560157724
description: 'Writing reusable React components can be difficult due to the need of custom appearance and behavior. As components authors we can achieve this by leaving the actual rendering of HTML/CSS to the component’s user. In this talk, Yakir Narkis shows a real life use case and code of a React component that don’t own rendering. Yakir shows advanced code patterns for writing React components that implement a concept called Inversion of Control, in order to achieve code reusability while keeping an easy to use API.'
