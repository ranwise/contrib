description: "Jump to 6:17 where we start. Today I’ve did a live coding show helping @Antonio Radosav and @Elena Țandără. We’ve made progress on codetap.academy as well.\nWe added the full name to the channel message list using axios nodejs library and waiting for the result of multiple JavaScript promises to be successful.\nhttps://codetap.academy/\nWe've used Balsamiq to create the mockups.
