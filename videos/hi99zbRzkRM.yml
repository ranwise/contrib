title: 'test && commit || revert. What?! - Kari Eline Strandjord'

description: "`test && commit || revert` is a workflow developed during a week of code camp at Iterate with Kent Beck. The main idea is that your code should always be in a valid state. If the test passes, the code is committed. If it fails, you lose all your changes, and the code is forced back to the last valid state. At first, the idea seemed both unrealistic and a bit harsh. But after trying it out during a longer period writing an application in Elm, it did change my way of coding. \n\nThe talk will give a brief explanation of the workflow. I will also share my experiences from using it in a real project.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
