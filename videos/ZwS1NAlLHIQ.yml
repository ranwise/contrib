description: "RailsConf 2019 -Service Architectures for Mere Mortals by Jamie Gaskins\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nCloud 66 - Pain Free Rails Deployments\nCloud 66 for Rails acts like your in-house DevOps team to build, deploy and maintain your Rails applications on any cloud or server.\n\nGet $100 Cloud 66 Free Credits with the code: RailsConf-19\n($100 Cloud 66 Free Credits, for the new user only, valid till 31st December 2019)\n\nLink to the website: https://cloud66.com/rails?utm_source=-&utm_medium=-&utm_campaign=RailsConf19\nLink to sign up: https://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_in?utm_source=-&utm_medium=-&utm_campaign=RailsConf19\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nYou may have heard the terms \"Microservices\" and \"Service-Oriented Architecture\" in the past, but you've tried to understand them by googling and asking people and that only resulted in either an incomplete picture of how it works or, more likely, a bunch of wildly varied and even conflicting information. Or maybe you do understand them, but getting from your Rails monolith to that structure is a fuzzy path at best.\n\nDuring this presentation, you will learn the basics of these ideas, the problems they solve, the tradeoffs they impose, and some ways to migrate to them."
