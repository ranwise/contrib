description: "Speaker: Shawn Wang @swyx\n\nThere is a lot of developer and investment interest in JAMStack technologies, from the serverless movement to new authentication models to continuous atomic deployment to the static site generator renaissance. But with so many new terms and options, it is hard for people to figure out where to start.\nThis workshop will teach developers to set up a simple but state of the art Gatsby stack, which lets people create blazing fast sites and apps with React and GraphQL, backed up by a continuous deployment and serverless platform complete with authentication and CMS. It has never been easier to get a great Lighthouse score, or to deploy complex, secure webapps for free.\n\nRequirements:\nAttendees should have git, Node.js and npm installed, and be proficient with JavaScript and React (including routing with @reach/router or react-router). \nInstall the Gatsby CLI's ahead of time: npm install -g gatsby-cli\nYou do not need to know GraphQL, but you can get a head start by reading https://graphql.org/learn/ and going through the Fundamentals section of https://www.howtographql.com/.\n\nOriginally from Singapore, swyx is an Infinite Builder working on Developer Experience at Netlify. In his free time he helps people Learn in Public at Egghead.io and /r/reactjs.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/pl3s/"
