description: "Laying the Foundation: Real World Kubernetes Deployment Patterns - Josh Rosso & Craig Tracey, VMware\n \nEnterprise deployments often find themselves gridlocked in debates concerning the \"correct\" approach for deploying Kubernetes. Should we use immutable images or a complex configuration management solution? What about leveraging one of the managed service offerings? Or even one of the opinionated open source projects? The possibilities are endless but can also be dizzying. In this talk, Josh and Craig provide an overview of both the successful (and sometimes not so successful) deployment patterns they have encountered across dozens of production Kubernetes users in nearly every industry vertical. They will identify the critical decision making processes that will enable \"Day 2\" operations, empower stakeholders, and ultimately yield successful Kubernetes outcomes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYg"
