title: 'Container-Relevant Upstream Kernel Developments'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510010101
description: 'There is a lot of work going on in upstream Linux by a number of different entities focused on making containers more featureful. For example, namespaced file capabilities, LSM stacking, namespaced integrity management, user-id shifting filesystems, and perhaps even a `struct container` definition in the kernel proper. In this talk, I''ll cover several of these sorts of container-relevant patchsets that have been proposed in the kernel, including motivating why they are interesting, as well as discussing where the patchsets need to go before being merged to mainline.'
