description: "EROFS, an Introduction and our Smartphone Practice - Xiang Gao, Huawei \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nEROFS filesystem is a Linux read-only file system in order to save extra storage space with guaranteed end-to-end performance for embedded devices, especially Android devices, which designs to reduce metadata compared with other generic filesystems and provide transparent compression support to target filesystem users.    In the past year 2018, EROFS has been developed, merged into Linux staging tree and landed to several smartphones. Note that it is still actively under development and more useful features will be added later.    This topic presents the issue and our practice of real-time decompression in consumer embedded devices, EROFS detailed design, benchmark, comparison with exist squashfs, compressed btrfs and the future roadmap of EROFS. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nru2"
