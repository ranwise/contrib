title: 'Kotlin coroutines: new ways to do asynchronous programming - Svetlana Isakova'
recordingDate: 1562323805
description: "The async/await feature allows you to write the asynchronous code in a straightforward way, without a long list of callbacks. Used in C# for quite a while already, it has proven to be extremely useful. In Kotlin you have async and await as library functions implemented using coroutines.\n\nA coroutine is a light-weight thread that can be suspended and resumed later. Very precise definition, but might be confusing at first. What 'light-weight thread' means? How does suspension work? This talk uncovers the magic.\nWe'll discuss the concept of coroutines, the power of async/await, and how you can benefit from defining your asynchronous computations using suspend functions.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
