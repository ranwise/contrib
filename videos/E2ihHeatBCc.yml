recordingDate: 1562069441
description: "The session will cover the design choices and lessons learned developing the multi-language free library segyio, or more conceptually, designing libraries for libraries.\n\nBriefly, it will discuss:\nStable API, ABI, and how to design them for the future\nHow to design C-interface libraries that allows for good foreign-language libraries (in our case python)\nLibrary design philosophy and the beauty of primitive functions\nHow to design for composition and caller flexibility\nPlumbing and porcelain\nThe session should appeal both to library developers for embedded systems, and consumers of higher-level libraries in desktop and scientific applications, as the topic covered is the bridge between primitive and sophisticated systems, and making it beautiful."
