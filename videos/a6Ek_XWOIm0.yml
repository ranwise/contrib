description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2019 - For more details, visit - http://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nUnderstanding business rules and processes in a complex enterprise environment should be high on a priority list for a development team, as a basic precondition to be able to create solutions that provide value to the users. In order to understand the business one must learn the language in which the business operates, i.e. a domain language.\n\nThis talk will present Domain Storytelling as a lightweight technique that helps teams learn domain language in a close collaboration with domain experts using pictographic notation while highlighting the users’ most urgent needs. Using Domain Storytelling is a visual and engaging exercise on the domain experts’ terms, enabling teams to acquire knowledge about the business in an efficient way. The talk will be based on a real-world use-case from a healthcare domain.\n\nBy the end of this talk you will be equipped with the fundamental knowledge needed to practice Domain Storytelling in your own context."
