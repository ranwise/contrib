title: 'The Digital Transformation is not Digital - Eline Giskeødegård'
recordingDate: 1535579406
description: "The digital transformation is still in its infant stage, but we can already see the difference between the players that are doing it right or getting it wrong.\nIoT, AI, Robotics, AR/VR and blockchain are all techs in the new wave of digital transformation. And both large corporations and small tech start-ups\n\nare continuous searching amongst them for the next big hit. But still are many failing at their attempt.\n\nWhy are they failing? What can we learn from winners of earlier digitalization waves? How can we exploit new technology without making tech the main focus of an innovation process? How can designers and techies collaborate closer to get ahead in the digitalization race?\n\nYou will leave the talk with a broader understanding of, and concrete tools to, developing new services and products in the era of digital transformation."
