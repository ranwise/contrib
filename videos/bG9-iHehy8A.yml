description: "!!Con 2019 - Anything is possible! Unlocking the Nightmarish Power of JavaScript via with and Proxy by Andrew Sillers\n\nJavaScript is often the butt of jokes about haphazard language design, but that jumbled design allows for some truly alarming power. If other languages let you shoot yourself in the foot, then JavaScript lets you grow tentacles and shoot yourself in those.\n\nFirst, we’ll dive into the mechanics of JavaScript’s scope chain. Then, we’ll learn how to break it by unmasking the secret lives of objects, variables, and identifiers. By combining one of JavaScript’s most powerful features with one of its worst, we can create a pocket dimension of code where anything is possible and nothing is as it seems. In the end, we’ll destroy JavaScript’s ability to associate variables with their values, so that we can make any variable refer any value, irrespective of the code being run."
