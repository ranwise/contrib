description: "Why is Cloud-Native Application Development Still So Hard? - Irene Zhang, Microsoft Research & University of Washington & Venugopal Reddy, Huawei \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCreating reliable, scalable, distributed cloud-native applications is still way too difficult for us mere mortal application developers. Why must we understand and solve complex distributed systems problems like data consistency, shard balancing, consensus algorithms, network partitions and exponential backoff just to build a straightforward business or social media app? Given that new real-world applications now also run across intermittently connected mobile devices, hybrid cloud servers, edge nodes, IoT devices etc, the problem is rapidly becoming even more difficult, to a point of being practically impossible.  Surely we can do much better than this?  Quinton and Irene will describe some of the recent advances in distributed systems R&D, and an open source distributed cloud operating system their groups have been collaborating on, that might just provide a way forward. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrlc"
