description: "Day 1: one engineer vs. a heap of time-series data on a 1990s-era databaseFour years on, there's 8 of us, we run TensorFlow analytics on a Hadoop cluster to detect subtle signs of a potential breakdown on earthmoving equipment. We've prevented million-dollar component failures, and reduced a lot of \"parasite\" stoppages.\n\nThis talk details the strategy and lessons learned from building an analytics department from scratch, in particular:\n\nMany analytics depts. were created as a \"Flavour of the month\". How do you approach this perception, survive and go beyond?\nChoosing the right projects to create a credible and sellable offering as quickly as possible to build your reputation.\nExpectation management, and choosing projects: Dealing with those who think \"it won't work\", and those who think you can solve all problems,\nGrowing from a \"start-up in a large company\" to a more mature group. Change management, scaling, velocity, etc.\nApproach to R&D and launching new projects, dealing with the \"shiny toys\"\n\nHi, I'm Antoine!\nI started as an electronics engineer, and after doing a PhD on Neural Networks, I caught the Data Science bug. I returned to Komatsu Australia in 2014 to start an analytics department the performs RHM (Remote Health Monitoring) on Komatsu's earthmoving equipment.\n\nWorking in the industry with an academic background, I worked on a blend of \"tried-and-tested\" solutions, as well as some of the bleeding edge techniques of analytics.\n\nI like to communicate: I have some blog posts on LinkedIn, podcasts, and have published papers at 3 research conferences last year - at my last presentation I was told it was both entertaining and enlightening!\n\nFor more on YOW!
