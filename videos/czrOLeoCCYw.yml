description: "Full Title: Looking at Sound: Computer Vision techniques in Audio Classification\n\nRaw audio is essentially a one-dimensional signal. Looking at the waveform, it’s often erratic en moving up en down thousands of times per second. It’s pretty hard to analyze as is. But after applying FFT, the signal becomes two-dimensional. Just like an image. We will cover some options and tradeoffs in applying this transformation.\n\nFor modeling, standard convolutional networks perform well. But as we’re dealing with audio, some things are a bit different. We will review some network architectures, augmentation techniques and some more advanced concepts that are specific for the audio domain.\n\nAudio analysis becomes even more interesting combined with other information sources such as text or video. The audio stream can contain hidden information that it not visible in an image or captured by words.\n\nWe will also look at two real-world applications for audio classification. Classifying noise pollution in a (smart) city environment and detecting emotions in a customer contact center.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
