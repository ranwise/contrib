We are going to use redux with react to help us grow and maintain larger apps.\n\nWe are going to be using react-redux which now offers a few new tools that easily integrate with react hooks, such as useSelector and useDispatch.\n\nI highly recommend you to watch my react for beginners video if you are having trouble following this tutorial.\n\nðŸ›´ Follow me on:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/deved94\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/developedbyed/\nGithub: https://github.com/DevEdwin\n\n\n#react #redux"
