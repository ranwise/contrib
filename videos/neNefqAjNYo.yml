description: "Introduction to JanusGraph Database - Jason Plurad, IBM \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nJanusGraph is a scalable graph database that is optimized to store and query graphs with billions of vertices and edges distributed across a multi-machine cluster. We'll share several uses cases from IBM products that take advantage of a graph database to highlight the strengths that graph provides over relational and other NoSQL alternatives. We'll discuss the JanusGraph architecture which gives developers the flexibility to leverage their knowledge and operational skills from other storage backends. We'll cover how open source developers from the community united to establish JanusGraph at the Linux Foundation, and then discuss JanusGraph project directions and opportunities to build out the open source graph ecosystem. \n\nhttps://sched.co/NrsI"
