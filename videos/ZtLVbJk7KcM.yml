description: "ðŸ’»https://github.com/CodingTrain/Intro-to-Data-APIs-JS \n\nWelcome to Module 3! I covered a lot about node.js in the previous module, but there are still a few key elements left to discuss!\n\nIn this module, I build the \"Weather Here\" project (based on example by Joey Lee). In this first video, I demonstrate how to connect to an external API from node.js itself. Later, I'll look at how to hide an API key as well as deploy a project to publicly accessible web server.. \n\nðŸ”— Dark Sky API: https://darksky.net/dev\nðŸ”— Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/\n\nðŸš‚ Website: http://thecodingtrain.com/ \nðŸ’– Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\nðŸ›’ Store: https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/codingtrain/\nðŸ“š Books: https://www.amazon.com/shop/thecodingtrain \n\nðŸŽ¥ Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\nðŸŽ¥ Intro to Programming: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA\n\nðŸ”— p5.js: https://p5js.org\nðŸ”— Processing: https://processing.org"
