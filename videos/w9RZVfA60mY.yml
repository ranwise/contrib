description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nOver the past few years, I’ve gained expertise in front-end web architecture. I’ve done this work at Indiegogo, Headspace, for my open source mental health project if-me.org, and in my current role at Mailchimp. At Indiegogo, we evaluated frameworks in an effort to migrate from AngularJS. At Headspace, I architected an MVP in React and created best practices. With if-me.org, we migrated to React from jQuery. At Mailchimp, we are migrating from Dojo to React.\n\nThis talk isn't about comparing frameworks, but rather the art of front-end architecture. Since I wouldn't be where I am today without the virtual pets site Neopets, I’ll be sharing the lessons I’ve learned in building out a sustainable team, prioritizing focus areas, evangelizing best practices, and advancing your career along the way. It’s like being a kid in the 2000s hustling for Neopoints and the coolest guild on the interwebs! I'll share insights on team communication, docs, testing, performance, accessibility, component design, and refactoring.\n\nAbout Julia Nguyen\nJulia Nguyen is a is a community organizer, writer, keynote speaker, and senior software engineer.
