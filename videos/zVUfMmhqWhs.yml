description: "Lightning Talk: Cluster of Palm-Sized Personal Kubernetes Clusters Using 100 Raspberry Pi - Masaya Aoyama, CyberAgent, Inc \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18) \n\nhttps://adtech.cyberagent.io/techblog/archives/4340  Using 100 Raspberry Pi, we build an at home personal Kubernetes cluster.    The era of having your own personal kubernetes cluster at home is here!  We have gathered over 30 university students in order to recruit them into ranks of Kubernetes fans.    First, each of them created a personal Kubernetes cluster with 3 Raspberry pi.  After that, we gathered everyoneâ€™s clusters, connected them to a 48 port switch and attempted to create a cluster of kubernetes clusters.    In this session, I will talk about a challenges building a cluster of kubernetes cluster.  And also, I will introduce an engaging way not to only learn about kubernetes but also to provide experience of building one.  This method of teaching will increase the number of Kubernetes fans around the world.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrs3"
