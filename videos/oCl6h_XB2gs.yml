description: "Enhancing Envoy: Certificate Handling at the Edge - Brian Redbeard & Bill Decoste, Red Hat \n\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in San Diego November 18 - 21. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2WdUyQ6. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nFor many users the nuances of SSL/TLS engines are fuzzy and differentiation is based on marketing terminology. To understand why some users desire (or require) the use of a specific public key infrastructure (PKI) toolkit we will analyze the work recently completed around adding support for OpenSSL to Envoy. In discussing this work we will outline how it enables cryptographic conformance with regulations like the United States Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 and how it benefits the community at large.  Participants should have familiarity with proxy servers so that they can follow along with the presentation. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Nrpj"
