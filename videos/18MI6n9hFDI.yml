description: "Video sponsor: Formidable (https://formidable.com/)\n\nAs video games have become more and more complex, game designers put way more time into creating environments where players are engaged and willing to put the time and effort into learning and mastering these skills.\n\nAs leads, we can learn a lot from how games are designed to make the internal developer experiences better, since itâ€™s a similar type of environment we want to create: an environment where people can learn and master skills. We should make it easier for developers to understand what options are available to them, allow them to make time for learning and provide structures and processes for them to develop the skills that they want and need for future roles.\n\nThis talk will look at how you can help level up your developers by using competencies and career development frameworks, what types of processes you can introduce to support personal development and how developers should be using opportunities like these to get a better understanding of what skills they should focus on.\n\nAbout Melinda Seckington\nMelinda is a Technical Manager at FutureLearn, a social learning platform. She loves attending BarCamps, Hackdays and other tech meetups, and since 2009 has been organising them at Geeks of London. She also writes at MissGeeky, a blog about all things geeky and girly."
